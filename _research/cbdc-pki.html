title: How to design a Public Key Infrastructure for a Central Bank Digital Currency
date: 2025-05-25
---

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</em> is a digital means of
payment, issued by a country’s (or region’s) central bank, denominated
in the national currency. According to the latest results of the annual
CBDC survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, 94% of
the respondents say they are working on digital currency <span
class="citation" data-cites="DiIorio2024">[<a href="#ref-DiIorio2024"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. As of 2024, many major central banks
are pushing forward with CBDC, including the European Central Bank with
their <em>Digital Euro</em> project.</p>
<p>While many of the projects are not yet in production stage, there is
an emerging view that a full launch encompasses at least the following
criteria <span class="citation" data-cites="Hupel2024">[<a
href="#ref-Hupel2024" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>continuous and uninterrupted availability for an indefinite
amount of time, i.e. no unannounced shutdown,</p></li>
<li><p>real legal tender that can always be exchanged at face value with
cash and deposit money,</p></li>
<li><p>no system resets, i.e. holdings will remain valid,</p></li>
<li><p>upgrade and maintenance work requires little to no intervention
from users, except for long-term hardware upgrades, similar to the 2-5
year cycle of bank cards and smartphones.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because CBDC is public digital infrastructure, it needs to satisfy
the highest resilience and security standards, at least on par with
national settlement and payment systems.</p>
<p>But there are also additional requirements unique to CBDC: As opposed
to traditional banking infrastructure, a CBDC would operate in 24/7 mode
and has thus very little room for maintenance and/or downtime.</p>
<p>
<strong>Structure of this paper.</strong>
The remainder of the introduction gives an overview over public key
infrastructure (PKI) (§<a href="#sec:intro-pki"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:intro-pki">1.1</a>) and
explains why it matters for CBDC (§<a href="#sec:intro-pki-matters"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:intro-pki-matters">1.2</a>). Afterwards, we discuss
related work (§<a href="#sec:related-work" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:related-work">2</a>): while ample literature about
both PKI and CBDC are available, little information is available how to
design a PKI for a production-grade CBDC.</p>
<p>To set the stage for the rest of the paper, we further introduce the
participants in a CBDC system (§<a href="#sec:participants"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:participants">3</a>).
Based on this, we can design the PKI, taking into consideration
pecularities of CBDC (§<a href="#sec:pki" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:pki">4</a>). Finally, we propose a certificate
rollover concept (§<a href="#sec:rollover" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:rollover">5</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec:intro-pki">Public key infrastructure</h3>
<p>The backbone of any digital currency is the correct use of
cryptographic materials and choosing appropriate security levels. This
includes selecting the right algorithms for encryption, key exchange,
digital signatures, and hash functions. More succinctly: getting the
cryptographic primitives right.</p>
<p>But just picking the right algorithm is not enough to build trust in
the whole system. Key material needs to be uniquely and verifiably
connected to all entities. Many entities need to be authenticated before
payments can happen, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>wallets need to authenticate each other;</p></li>
<li><p>the central bank want to ensure that only authorized wallets are
used to hold currency; and</p></li>
<li><p>commercial banks need to confirm that the counterparties they are
exchanging money with are genuinely who they claim to be.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</em> is the solution to these
problems. By mapping public key materials to abstract entities in a
certificate, participants in the network can always rely on the
authenticity of their communication partners. This requires a root of
trust—a central authority—from which all certificates are derived. In
the case of CBDC, this would be the central bank.</p>
<p>Trusting these derived certificates is a result of users trusting the
central bank. For that, the central bank must have proper processes in
place to ensure a secure certificate life cycle. This entails handling
<em>Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)</em>, rights and roles, and
organisational procedures. RFC 3647 <span class="citation"
data-cites="RFC3647">[<a href="#ref-RFC3647"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span> provides a good overview of key
considerations for designing a PKI.</p>
<p>Focusing on CBDC, this paper explores PKI design decisions,
authenticated entities requiring certificates, and how a seamless
certificate rollover can be handled.</p>
<h3 id="sec:intro-pki-matters">Why is PKI significant for CBDC?</h3>
<p>Outages caused by public key infrastructure, for example expired or
wrong certificates, can cause significant damage. This affects many
industry domains <span class="citation" data-cites="Hickman2024">[<a
href="#ref-Hickman2024" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>For example, in 2023, a certificate with a mismatched top-level
domain caused a short service interruption in Microsoft Sharepoint
services <span class="citation" data-cites="Abrams2023">[<a
href="#ref-Abrams2023" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>. While the
problem was quickly fixed, it affected many customers across major
services (including Microsoft Teams).</p>
<p>Hardware may also be impacted: in the same year, Cisco hardware was
affected by certificates expiring after their 10 year lifetime <span
class="citation" data-cites="Chervek2023">[<a href="#ref-Chervek2023"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. Renewing certificates in hardware is
notoriously complicated, since devices may not be directly connected to
the internet and are therefore out of the manufacturer’s control.</p>
<p>There is one known instance of a PKI issue impacting the operation of
a CBDC. The Eastern Carribean Central Bank suffered from an outage in
2022, caused by expired certificates in <em>Hyperledger Fabric</em>, the
DLT employed by the bank <span class="citation"
data-cites="Crothers2022">[<a href="#ref-Crothers2022"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>. As mentioned in the introduction,
CBDC is a national payment infrastructure, therefore prolonged service
interruptions can cause problems for the economy.</p>
<p>Assuming broad adoption of a CBDC in a given jurisdiction, and the
potential use of digital currency in industrial applications, it becomes
clear that a PKI supporting a currency’s infrastructure must be highly
resilient. Already today, many industries see “an upward trend in
certificate numbers” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Keyfactor2023">[<a href="#ref-Keyfactor2023"
role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>. CBDC wallets exacerbate the problem,
because they rely on individual certificates per wallet.</p>
<h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>
<p>There are already numerous PKIs deployed and used. Perhaps the most
prominent example is the PKI used for internet, where multiple
certificate authorities issue certificates in the X.509 format to a
variety of servers, including for HTTP (web), SMTP (mail), and other
protocols.</p>
<p>In this work, we argue that CBDC is an application that requires and
deserves a dedicated PKI (§§<a href="#sec:related-work"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:related-work">2</a>, <a
href="#sec:participants" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:participants">3</a>). The main reasons for that
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>existing PKI—particularly the decentralized internet PKI—is not
specifically designed for the security needs of a CBDC system;</p></li>
<li><p>the need for custom features and formats (see also §<a
href="#sec:pki:format" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:pki:format">4.2</a>);</p></li>
<li><p>allowing the central bank to exert control over the system and
its design;</p></li>
<li><p>disaster recovery procedures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further evidence to this special status is that today, many financial
and/or government applications already use dedicated PKI. Prime examples
for this are the <em>ICAO Public Key Directory</em> for validating
passports and other digital identity documents <span class="citation"
data-cites="SecureIdentityAlliance2022">[<a
href="#ref-SecureIdentityAlliance2022"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>, <em>SwiftNet</em> for financial
messaging, and <em>SM-PKI</em> for smart electricity meters.</p>
<p>We contribute a comprehensive analysis of the security parameters of
CBDC ecosystems, and from that, derive a PKI design that takes specifics
of digital currencies into account. The major difference to existing
PKIs is the need to accommodate for unpowered, intermittently offline
devices communicating directly with each other (§<a
href="#sec:rollover:specifics" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:rollover:specifics">5.2</a>), which greatly
complicates the issuance and renewal of certificates in the field. For
example, current hardware-baed payment schemes like credit cards, do not
offer person-to-person payments, and can therefore afford a simpler
design.</p>
<p>Finally, we contribute a rollover concept for seamless operation of
the system that could be generalized for other applications.</p>
<h2 id="sec:related-work">Related work</h2>
<p>The literature has already acknowledged the need for robust and
scalable Public Key Infrastructure for CBDC and other digital asset
systems.</p>
<p>Several publications <span class="citation"
data-cites="Chu2022 Christodorescu2020 Zhang2024 Yang2022">[<a
href="#ref-Chu2022" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>–<a href="#ref-Yang2022"
role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span> highlight the use of PKI for offline
payments. The core idea is that wallets carry certificates signed by an
authority, e.g. the central bank. These can be used for mutual
authentication between a pair of wallets before or during a transaction.
This establishes trust in an offline scenario. Illegitimate wallets are
consequently excluded from the system and cannot inject counterfeit
money. As Chu <em>et al.</em> summarize, a PKI “allows safe transactions
even though the certificate authority is offline, since a certificate
states whether the counterpart is a trusted user” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Chu2022">[<a href="#ref-Chu2022"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Takagari <em>et al.</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Takaragi2023">[<a href="#ref-Takaragi2023"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span> investigate the role PKI plays for
<em>Know-your-customer (KYC)</em> checks. The authors develop a
privacy-enhanced PKI by which a “financial institution verifies the
identity of a prospective customer,” based on the national ID, while
simultaneously protecting the customer’s personal information.</p>
<p>According to Han <em>et al.</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Han2019">[<a href="#ref-Han2019"
role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>, a PKI is a core ingredient for the
regulatory layer of a CBDC. Their goal is “the supervision of objects
such as banks and third parties in network layer and users and
transaction in user layer.” Similarly, Zhang writes that the role of PKI
is “maintaining trust within the network of entities authorized to
operate the CBDC system” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Zhang2024">[<a href="#ref-Zhang2024"
role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Our previous research <span class="citation"
data-cites="Hupel2024">[<a href="#ref-Hupel2024"
role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span> identifies PKI as an instrumental
part of any CBDC ecosystem. In particular, we have evaluated the various
cryptographic keys and their algorithms involved, to understand how they
are affected by the migration to post-quantum cryptography. This is
echoed by Zhang, who explains that “the PKI infrastructure adopted by
the central bank should be quantum ready” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Zhang2024">[<a href="#ref-Zhang2024"
role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In the related field of <em>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)</em>,
there is literature outlining the use of PKI for operating permissioned
ledgers, i.e., where access control limits the participation in the
system. For example, <em>Hyperledger Fabric</em>, uses PKI for
“signature generation, verification, and authentication” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Campbell2019">[<a href="#ref-Campbell2019"

class="citation" data-cites="Pal2021">[<a href="#ref-Pal2021"
role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> survey some PKI strategies for major
blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>The ISO has published <em>Technical Report (TR)</em> 24374, entitled
“Security information for PKI in blockchain and DLT implementations”. It
discusses “the impact of different types of key management processes
that are required for PKI implementations in Blockchain and DLT
projects” <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO24374">[<a

<h2 id="sec:participants">Participants in a CBDC ecosystem</h2>
<p>For this paper, we assume a CBDC system with the following
characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>a two-tier distribution model</strong>, i.e., the central
bank manages the supply of money and commercial banks are responsible
for distributing money to individuals and businesses;<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>unbanked individuals are included</strong>, i.e., people
without a formal bank account can get access to CBDC, with notable
groups being rural citizens without access to a bank branch, children,
and tourists;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>a wide spectrum of wallets are available</strong>,
allowing for both online and offline payments, especially hardware
wallets embodied e.g. as smartcards;</p></li>
<li><p>at least the payment scenarios <strong>C2B/B2C</strong>
(customer-to-business/business-to-customer) and <strong>P2P</strong>
(person-to-person) are supported;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>a central bank ledger validates transactions</strong>,
with the concrete operational model (DLT/non-DLT) abstracted for this
paper.</p></li>
</ul>

<figcaption>Participants and communication channels in a CBDC
ecosystem</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The assumptions specified above give rise to a CBDC system that works
similarly to cash. As the Hong Kong Monetary Authority points out, a
CBDC is “best designed as part of a two-tier system, with an appropriate
division of labour between the central bank and private sector
intermediaries for the distribution and circulation of CBDC” <span
class="citation" data-cites="HKMA2021">[<a href="#ref-HKMA2021"
role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section spells out the participants in the system and what their
roles and responsibilities are: (1) the central bank, (2) financial
service providers, and (3) individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>As noted above, wallets can come in different form factors, including
hardware wallets such as smartcards. They are typically manufactured by
a dedicated entity (see also Figure <a
href="#fig:communication-channels" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:communication-channels">1</a>). But we set aside
card manufacturing for now and will revisit this later in §<a
href="#sec:pki:smartcard" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:pki:smartcard">4.1.2</a>.</p>
<p>To keep it as simple as possible, we exclude a treatment of risk
management, including fraud detection and investigation. This may
require additional participants and communication channels.</p>
<h3 id="central-bank">Central bank</h3>
<p>The central bank focuses on “providing the core, foundational
infrastructure of a CBDC, guaranteeing the stability of its value and
overseeing the system’s security” <span class="citation"
data-cites="HKMA2021">[<a href="#ref-HKMA2021"
role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>. This includes, but is not limited
to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>manage the monetary supply through minting and burning of
CBDC;</p></li>
<li><p>operate the central bank ledger and validating transactions
<em>(Central Register)</em>;</p></li>
<li><p>distribute CBDC to commercial banks;</p></li>
<li><p>set rules and regulations for participants;</p></li>
<li><p>operate the root certificate authority of the PKI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To a limited extent, the central bank could also provide CBDC
wallets, for example to allow commercial banks the 1:1 exchange of
central bank reserves for CBDC.</p>
<p>The central bank provides various communication channels. Any
participant can query the Central Register to validate CBDC. It must
also communicate with FSPs.</p>
<h3 id="financial-service-providers">Financial service providers</h3>
<p>Commercial banks, or more broadly, <em>financial service providers
(FSPs)</em>, are responsible “to provide retail services to customers on
a competitive basis, and leverage their network effects to innovate in
business and service models” <span class="citation"
data-cites="HKMA2021">[<a href="#ref-HKMA2021"
role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>. Just like today, banks are the
first point of contact for individuals and businesses. Their services
include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>perform user onboarding, e.g. by checking their identity, to
comply with Know-your-customer (KYC) regulation;</p></li>
<li><p>open and operate custodial customer wallets, and develop
smartphone apps for customers to access their funds;</p></li>
<li><p>issue hardware devices to customers and (potentially) unbanked
individuals, to allow for offline payments and to enable unbanked people
to participate in the CBDC ecosystem;</p></li>
<li><p>distribute CBDC to their customers by providing exchange between
deposit money, cash and CBDC;</p></li>
<li><p>value-add services such as insurances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>FSPs communicate directly with their customers, with the central
bank, and with other FSPs. They also provide communication channels to
initiate and execute payments at the point of sale, as well as ATM
operations, which may be proxied through existing systems and is
therefore not specific to CBDC.</p>
<p>Note that some jurisdictions are considering the central bank to also
act as a retail service provider, for example to aid financial
inclusion. In other jurisdictions, non-banks (such as post offices) are
thought to take over this role.</p>
<h3 id="individuals-and-businesses">Individuals and businesses</h3>
<p>Finally, the users of the system: individuals and businesses are
exchanging CBDC with each other and/or use CBDC to pay for goods and
services.</p>
<p>While details differ across jurisdictions, the most typical
representatives of this group are local residents and merchants (both
physical and online). Subject to various limits, they can obtain CBDC
wallets and transact with each other. As opposed to traditional payment
systems, CBDC payments are symmetric: a merchant’s wallet will differ
from an individual’s wallet only in configuration.</p>
<p>Depending on the precise payment scenario, wallets will use different
communication channels for executing payments. In offline situations, it
will typically be a connection based on proximity protocols such as NFC
or Bluetooth, establishing direct peer-to-peer communication. But there
can also be online scenarios, where a user instructs their FSP to
execute a payment.</p>
<h2 id="sec:pki">PKI concept</h2>
<p>Just like cash, the trust in CBDC derives from the trust of
participants in the central bank. This trust is the foundation of the
secure operation of any CBDC ecosystem. As outlined above, such an
ecosystem requires a number of entities.</p>
<p>These entities have a wide range of requirements. For example, some
entities are operated by the central bank itself, while others are
completely outside its control. This section explains the certificate
hierarchy, as well as technical and procedural concerns.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy</h3>
<figure id="fig:pki-hierarchy">
  <img src="{% link assets/img/research/cbdc-pki/pki-hierarchy.drawio.pdf.svg %}" alt="">
<figcaption>Proposed PKI hierarchy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The central bank is the trust anchor of the whole system, but cannot
perform all necessary processes required for a trustworthy system. It
must, therefore, delegate trust towards other entities, such as
financial service providers or manufacturers. That notwithstanding, the
central bank still holds full responsibility for their correct
operation, and therefore operates the <em>Root CA</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the central bank imposes requirements to these thirds
parties and enforces compliance. Ideally, the processes carried out by
third parties shall be audited by the central bank.</p>
<p>The requirements in this policy could be published. This enables
participants to understand how the PKI operates and establishes a
factual basis for their trust.</p>
<p>Certificates with similar security levels should be clustered under
the same <em>Certificate Authority (CA)</em>, since certificates issued
by the CA fulfill the same requirements towards issuance, revocation,
delivery and further relevant processes. We cluster certificates into
three categories (Figure <a href="#fig:pki-hierarchy"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:pki-hierarchy">2</a>).</p>
<h4 id="fsp-certificates">FSP certificates</h4>
<p>A financial service provider may only participate in the CBDC
ecosystem after the central bank’s approval. After onboarding, they
would be equipped with a certificate that allows them to prove their
identity to customers and other FSPs.</p>
<p>FSPs are authorized to open and operate wallets for customers. The
FSPs will typically also have custody of private key material of their
customers. Whenever a payment across banks is made, the parties need to
make sure that their respective counterparty holds a valid CBDC
wallet.</p>
<p>From the user perspective, being a customer of an FSP already assumes
(implicit) trust towards the FSP. Therefore, FSPs are already trusted to
route payments to the desired receiver wallet, and no additional
security gain can be achieved by equipping each online wallet with their
own key material to authenticate the wallet. The necessary trust is
already achieved by validating the FSP certificate, and let the FSP take
care of routing and payment flows.</p>
<p>This way, there are trust relationships between a user and their
bank, as well as between a bank and the central bank, but not between
different banks.</p>
<h4 id="sec:pki:smartcard">Smartcard certificates</h4>
<p>Similar to credit cards, the FSPs are responsible for distributing
hardware wallets, such as smartcards, to their customers.</p>
<p>In a CBDC ecosystem, peer-to-peer payments between wallets are
allowed. This means that not all payments are routed through an
intermediary. As a consequence, smartcards must be able to authenticate
each other directly, which is especially important for offline
payments.</p>
<p>The central bank bears ultimate responsibility that all smartcards
are trustworthy. Since central banks typically do not manufacture those
themselves, they will delegate this process to trusted smartcard
manufacturers.</p>
<p>To guarantee flexibility and limit dependence on a singular smartcard
manufacturer, multiple manufacturers should be supported.</p>
<p>Hence, the central bank should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>select a number of trustworthy smartcard manufacturers;</p></li>
<li><p>issue and provide each smartcard manufacturer with an individual
certificate;</p></li>
<li><p>deliver the Root CA certificate securely to those
manufacturers;</p></li>
<li><p>ensure that the manufacturers comply with the rules and process
requirements, which should happen contractually and with the help of a
<em>Certification Practice Statement</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="RFC3647">[<a href="#ref-RFC3647"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>perform on-site audits on the facilities to ensure the
manufacturers comply with the requirements (optional).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Parts of this could also be delegated through FSPs, who may want to
follow their own procurement procedures.</p>
<h4 id="operational-certificates">Operational certificates</h4>
<p>The tasks that are performed by the central bank might be performed
by different entities within the central bank itself. Naturally, this
implies that multiple entities within the central bank need to hold
individual certificates, for example:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Minting</dt>
<dd>
<p>A system authorized to mint new money in a secure environment. There
may also be personalized certificates for one or more central bank
employees carrying private key material in a secure device.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Central Register</dt>
<dd>
<p>A ledger tracking authenticity of money, thereby confirming the
validity of digital money; this system itself might be hierarchical
(depending on choice of DLT or not).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Timestamp Service</dt>
<dd>
<p>A backend system that provides signed timestamps based on a trusted
clock.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The exact entities might differ depending on the broader design
decisions for the CBDC.</p>
<h3 id="sec:pki:format">Certificate format</h3>
<p>The state-of-the-art certificate format used in most industry use
cases is <em>X.509</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="RFC5280">[<a
href="#ref-RFC5280" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>. In addition to
subject identifier and public key, it provides many more certificate
fields.</p>
<p>The X.509 standard has some drawbacks in environments with limited
computation power, such as IoT devices or smartcards. Any auxiliary data
and certificate fields slow down payments.</p>
<p>The obvious choice for a stripped down X.509 certificate format,
specifically designed for smartcards, are <em>Card Verifiable (CV)</em>
certificates <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO7816-8">[<a
href="#ref-ISO7816-8" role="doc-biblioref">22</a>]</span>. They enable
smartcards to perform certificate operations with limited resources and
power. In contrast to X.509, CV certificates are much smaller and do not
contain irrelevant information, thereby accelerating transaction
processing.</p>
<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>
<p>In any PKI, handling compromised certificates is crucial to ensure
prompt invalidation and maintaining the trust and security of the
system. There are two ways for this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Technical handling of compromised certificates (Revocation). The
CA can revoke certificates in its system and provide this information to
the relying parties<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)</em> are publicly
available lists of revoked (but not expired) certificates. Whenever a
certificate is validated, its revocation status can be looked up in the
CRL. CRLs are issued (signed) by the responsible CA (or a dedicated CRL
Signer).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)</em> allows the
validating entity of the certificate to request the revocation status at
a publicly available OCSP responder, which answers with good, revoked,
or unknown.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Organizational handling of compromised certificates. Certificates
are not technically revoked, but the validating entities are manually
informed about compromised certificates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All of these approaches come with various problems.</p>
<p>CRLs have to be regularly updated, and revocation information may not
be up-to-date at the time of the revocation check.</p>
<p>OCSP comes with a lot of additional traffic and, more importantly,
with a significant privacy risk: OCSP requests are not encrypted and
intercepting this traffic would reveal the certificates to be validated.
This would clearly reveal communication metadata, weakening privacy.</p>
<p>Organizational handling of compromised certificates is difficult when
the relying parties are numerous and unknown.</p>
<p>Payments demand high transaction throughput and low latency. Any
additional data transfer within a transaction—including revocation
status checks—must be carefully considered. Both CRL and OCSP lead to
slower transactions.</p>
<p>Since the number of certificates in the PKI fairly limited, the
organizational handling of compromised certificates should be considered
instead. The relying parties are mostly controlled by the central bank,
which means that in case of a malicious FSP, the central bank can simply
unplug them from the system. The same is applicable to compromised
operational certificates.</p>
<p>In offline payment scenarios, CRL and OCSP are not applicable for the
lack of internet connection. OCSP stapling as an alternative method can
be considered, even though they also increase the traffic and lead to
longer transaction times.</p>
<h2 id="sec:rollover">Certificate rollover</h2>
<p>In order to guarantee smooth transition between Root CA
certificates—and therefore uninterrupted functionality of the
PKI—rollover procedures are needed. For online entities, this is
relatively easy, since certificates can be transmitted online for
real-time updates. This is applicable to every entity in the PKI except
for the smartcards.</p>
<p>Smartcards are offline entities which may, after production, rarely
connect to an online service. This gives rise to some additional
complication that go beyond normal rollover procedures.</p>
<h3 id="standard-rollover">Standard rollover</h3>

<figcaption>Conceptual CA rollover (standard case)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Normally, a certificate rollover consists of three phases (see
Figure <a href="#fig:rollover:standard" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:rollover:standard">3</a>). In the first phase, only
the old Root CA certificate is used to issue certificates and verify
certificates based on the old Root CA certificate.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second phase, a new Root CA certificate is
created. New certificates in this period will be issued with the new
Root CA certificate. Verification of certificates based of the old Root
CA certificate will be verified with the old Root CA certificate, while
certificates based on the new Root CA certificate will be verified with
the new Root CA certificate.</p>
<p>Finally, only the new Root CA certificate is used to issue new
certificates as well as verifying certificates. This completes the
rollover.</p>
<h3 id="sec:rollover:specifics">CBDC and hardware wallet specifics</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of hardware wallets, certain complications need to
be handled.</p>
<h4 id="pinning">Pinning</h4>
<p>In order to guarantee functionality and security over their lifetime,
certificates should be pinned in smartcards. These pins could be
especially protected, e.g. through hardcoding, to prevent tampering.</p>
<p>For the smartcards, the pinned certificates are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Root CA certificate</p></li>
<li><p>Timestamp Service certificate</p></li>
<li><p>Central Register certificate</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned certificates, the smartcard holds
its own certificate chain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>End-Entity (EE) (wallet) certificate</p></li>
<li><p>Manufacturer CA certificate</p></li>
<li><p>Hardware CA certificate</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="root-ca-ramp-up">Root CA ramp up</h4>
<p>The Root CA certificate is the trust anchor on which the PKI builds.
When the Root CA certificate expires, every certificate based on that
Root CA certificate loses its validity. For hardware wallets thay may be
offline for extended amounts of time, a new Root CA certificate has to
be created in advanced to it becoming active. Therefore, as compared to
the standard rollover procedure (Figure <a href="#fig:rollover:standard"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:rollover:standard">3</a>),
we need to add an initial <em>ramp up</em> phase: in this phase, the new
Root CA certificate is issued, but not active (i.e., does not sign any
certificates). Still, it would be installed alongside the old Root CA
certificates in the smartcards.</p>
<h4 id="smartcard-manufacturer">Smartcard manufacturer</h4>
<p>The certificate a manufacturer receives has a limited
validity time. But, upon receiving a certificate, it should be able to
manufacture smartcards over a period of time independent of the issuing
date. PKI rollover should be planned such that no change in the
certificate chain should be needed after the initial phase, where all
necessary certificates for production have been gathered. The validity
of the smartcard manufacturer certificate has to be verifiable as long
as there are smartcards in circulation based on that certificate.</p>
<h4 id="smartcard-validity-period">Smartcard validity period</h4>
<p>Smartcards that leave the manufacturer should always have the same
lifetime, independent of their manufacturing date. Therefore, the
complete certificate chain must be verifiable as long as those
smartcards are circulating. This is true not only for online services,
but also for mutual authentication.</p>
<h3 id="solution-requirements">Solution requirements</h3>
<p>We define the validity period of a smartcard certificate, denoted as
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>u</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1u</annotation></semantics></math>,
as the base unit in our concept. This can be defined by the central bank
and will typically be a few years. All other validity periods are
derived from this unit.</p>
<p>Following the specifics for CBDC explained in the previous section,
we consider the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All necessary certificates to conduct payments must be present on
the smartcard for offline usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Root CA, Central Register and Timestamp Service certificates must
be pinned on the smartcard.</p></li>
<li><p>A smartcard must be usable for its entire lifetime without
updating pinned certificates.</p></li>
<li><p>Smartcard manufacturer certificates must be able to be issued at
any time.</p></li>
<li><p>Smartcard manufacturers should be able to manufacture smartcards
for a defined amount of time without updating their facilities with new
certificates after receiving all necessary certificates from the central
bank.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This results in the necessity of a ramp up phase for certain
certificates (Figure <a href="#fig:rollover:cbdc"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:rollover:cbdc">4</a>). The
details are explained per certificate in the following sections.</p>
<figure id="fig:rollover:cbdc">

phase)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="hardware-ca-strand">Hardware CA strand</h3>
<h4 id="manufacturer-ca">Manufacturer CA</h4>
<p>The smartcard manufacturer must be able to issue certificates at any
point in time during its active phase.</p>
<p>The validity period of a the CA certificate is dependent on two
factors. The active time is the period during which smartcards are
manufactured based on a certain Root CA certificate. The passive time is
the subsequent validity period of a smartcard, since functionality has
to be guaranteed after manufacturing.</p>
<p>Therefore, the active and passive phases of the CA must each be at
least as long as the smartcard validity period:
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">Active</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Manufacturer CA</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>≥</mo><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">Passive</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Manufacturer CA</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>≥</mo><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr></mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<h4 id="hardware-ca">Hardware CA</h4>
<p>The same reasoning can be applied to Hardware CA certificates, since
they also must be able to issue Manufacturer CA certificates at any
point in time. Since their validity period is at least
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>u</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2u</annotation></semantics></math>,
with each of the phases being at least
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>u</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">u</annotation></semantics></math>,
we get:
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">Active</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Hardware CA</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>≥</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">Passive</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Hardware CA</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>≥</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr></mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{aligned}

  \text{Passive}(\text{Hardware CA}) &amp;\geq 2u
\end{aligned}</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<h3 id="operational-ca-strand">Operational CA strand</h3>
<p>It must be ensured that all circulating smartcards pin the currently
used Central Register certificate. Therefore, the <em>ramp up</em> phase
of the Central Register certificate must be at least the smartcard
validity period.
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">RampUp</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Central Register</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>=</mo><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">Active</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Central Register</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>≥</mo><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">Passive</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Central Register</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"></mtd></mtr></mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{aligned}

  \text{Active}(\text{Central Register}) &amp;\geq u \\
  \text{Passive}(\text{Central Register}) &amp;= 0 \\
\end{aligned}</annotation></semantics></math> The same applies to the
timestamp service: It is highly recommended to use the same validity
period.</p>
<h4 id="minting">Minting</h4>
<p>The minting certificate is not relevant for smartcards. The only
requirement is that its validity never exceeds the validity of the
Operational CA. A canonical validity period is therefore
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>u</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2u</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
<h3 id="financial-ca-strand">Financial CA strand</h3>
<p>This strand is not critical, since its certificates are all issued
online. We can therefore use
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>u</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2u</annotation></semantics></math>
as the period for FSP certificates, and the same values for the
Financial CA as the Operational CA.</p>
<h3 id="root-ca">Root CA</h3>
<p>At the time of activation of the new Root CA certificate, all
circulating smartcards must already know the new certificate. Therefore,
the ramp up phase must be at least u.</p>
<p>Unlike the Hardware CA and the Manufacturer CA, the Root CA
certificate does not need to be able to issue certificates at all times.
Rather, it creates subordinate CA certificates only at specific points.
The only requirement is that issued certificates are valid along their
whole lifetime.</p>
<p>To ensure that smartcard certificates issued on the last day of
validity of the Hardware CA, we obtain a passive phase for the Root CA
of at least 2u.</p>
<p>To summarize:
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">RampUp</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Root CA</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>=</mo><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">Passive</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Root CA</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>≥</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"><mtext mathvariant="normal">Active</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Root CA</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mo>+</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Passive</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Root CA</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign="left" style="text-align: left"><mo>≥</mo><mn>4</mn><mi>u</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right" style="text-align: right"></mtd></mtr></mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{aligned}

<p>For simplicity, all direct
subordinate CAs (Hardware, Operational, Financial CAs) should have the
same total validity period. If possible, it also makes sense to set use
the same active and passive periods, even if conceptually not strictly
necessary.</p>

accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have discussed how any CBDC system needs to authenticate entities
and thus equip them with certificates. Since the trust in the system
hinges on the trust in the central bank, we proposed to employ a Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) operated by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>In particular, we introduced categories of certificates with similar
security requirements and security processes, which lead us to a PKI
design with concrete certificate authorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we investigated certificate formats and revocation
procedures and concluded that stripped down X.509 certificates, such as
CV Certificates, are appropriate for CBDC use.</p>
<p>Technical certificate revocation procedures may negatively affect
transaction throughput and performance. As an alternative, operational
revocation procedures turned out to be most appropriate, since, in
contrast to typical PKIs, relying parties are known beforehand. This
leads to manageable revocation procedures at the relying parties,
instead of a singe point of revocation status checks, such as OCSP
responders and CRLs.</p>
<p>Finally, we proposed a rollover concept for a PKI, which enables
seamless operation despite regularly scheduled certificate expirations.
This rollover concept is generic and can be tailored to specific central
bank needs. The smallest unit of validity is the smartcard validity
period, which can be chosen to be any timeframe desired, and can be
multiplied appropriately.</p>
