      We present a trustworthy connection between the Leon verification
      system and the Isabelle proof assistant. Leon is a system for verifying functional
      Scala programs. It uses a variety of automated theorem provers (ATPs) to check
      verification conditions (VCs) stemming from the input program. Isabelle, on the
      other hand, is an interactive theorem prover used to verify mathematical specifications
      using its own input language Isabelle/Isar. Users specify (inductive)
      definitions and write proofs about them manually, albeit with the help of semiautomated
      tactics. The integration of these two systems allows us to exploit Isabelle’s
      rich standard library and give greater confidence guarantees in the correctness
      of analysed programs.
