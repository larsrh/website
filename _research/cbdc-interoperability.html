title: Interoperability aspects of CBDC across ecosystems and borders

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The vast majority of central banks around the world are investigating
or piloting <em>a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</em>, with a
select few already running live systems. Although there is no single
universal definition of CBDC as of writing, it is commonly understood to
be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>a digital representation of a country’s or region’s
existing currency:</strong> this means that the CBDC will be denoted in
the same currency and be 1:1 exchangeable for other types of money, such
as deposit money, in a way that resembles cash;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>issued directly by the central bank:</strong> unlike
deposit money and e-money, which is issued by private entities, CBDC
represents a direct claim on the issuing central bank and therefore, the
central bank has full control over its supply;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>usable in electronic payments:</strong> unlike cash,
which can only be used for payments in physical proximity, CBDC as
digital money can be used both offline and online; and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>legal tender:</strong> the ability to use CBDC for any
purpose and to discharge monetary obligations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Bank for International Settlements (BIS)</em>, an
international financial body whose membership comprises over 60 central
banks, succinctly defines CBDC as a “digital payment instrument,
denominated in the national unit of account, which is a direct liability
of the central bank” <span class="citation" data-cites="Kosse2023">[<a
href="#ref-Kosse2023" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. For a

  Comparison of CBDC to some common payment instruments and digital assets
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While not strictly necessary according to the above definitions, CBDC
payments are usually expected to be settled instantly. In terms of
accessibility, we can distinguish two types of CBDC. <em>Retail CBDC
(rCBDC)</em> can be used by anyone in the country, whereas <em>Wholesale
CBDC (wCBDC)</em> is only available for regulated financial
intermediaries <span class="citation" data-cites="Presto2023">[<a
href="#ref-Presto2023" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>. The name
refers to the idea that the former allows for retail payments, whereas
the latter would be used by financial institutions.</p>
<p>BIS’ latest survey report about central banks’ engagement in CBDC and
other digital assets found that in 2022, 93% of central banks are
conducting work on “some form of CBDC” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kosse2023">[<a href="#ref-Kosse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. Of those, about three quarters are
focusing both on retail and wholesale CBDC. This suggests that both
types have distinct use cases that cannot be easily achieved within a
single framework.</p>
<p>Concretely, the survey suggests that “work on wholesale CBDC is
driven mainly by the desire to enhance cross-border payments” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kosse2023">[<a href="#ref-Kosse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. Awareness of this topic reaches back
at least four years: In 2019, <em>Bank of Canada</em> and the Monetary
Authority of Singapore published a design paper of “Project
Jasper–Ubin”, in which both banks investigated cross-border payments
between their jurisdictions <span class="citation"
data-cites="BankOfCanada2019">[<a href="#ref-BankOfCanada2019"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. Additionally, in 2020, the
<em>Financial Stability Board (FSB)</em> has identified the need of
“factoring an international dimension into CBDC design” as a building
block towards enhancing cross-border payments <span class="citation"
data-cites="FSB2020">[<a href="#ref-FSB2020"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>From these developments, it becomes clear that any CBDC
implementation will not realize its full potential in isolation, but in
combination with other types of domestic or cross-border CBDC. More
broadly, it means that CBDCs must be interoperable with other payment
systems. According to the BIS definition, participating institutions,
for example from different jurisdictions, should be able to “conduct,
clear and settle payments across systems without participating in
multiple systems” <span class="citation" data-cites="Boar2021">[<a
href="#ref-Boar2021" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>.</p>
<h2 id="unique-challenges-and-opportunities-with-cbdc">Unique challenges
and opportunities with CBDC</h2>
<p>In the broader context of payments, interoperability is not a novel
topic. This year, the BIS and Bank of England have published a report on
“Project Meridian,” linking the Bank’s real-time gross settlement system
(RTGS) to a digitized land registry through a synchronisation operator.
The purpose of the project was to demonstrate how to facilitate a
delivery-vs-payment approach for housing transactions, essentially
reducing the settlement risk by synchronising the multiple fund and
asset transfers involved in a real estate transaction. The key ideas are
to represent the real estate deed digitally on a ledger and to earmark
funds in the RTGS before the transaction is completed, thereby
preventing them from being misused <span class="citation"
data-cites="BIS2023Meridian">[<a href="#ref-BIS2023Meridian"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>There has also been work conducted regarding synchronisation of
instant payment solutions across countries to facilitate cross-border
payments. A report from last year describes a prototype to synchronise
USD and EUR instant payment systems, where “settlement in one system is
made conditional to the settlement in the next system”, therefore
providing strong guarantees about the progress of a transaction <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kulk2022">[<a href="#ref-Kulk2022"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>. A similar project has been
undertaken by BIS, linking the Eurozone’s, Malaysia’s, and Singapore’s
instant payment systems <span class="citation"
data-cites="BIS2023Nexus">[<a href="#ref-BIS2023Nexus"
role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>As the BIS notes, a “retail CBDC differs from existing forms of
cashless payment instruments [...], as it represents a direct claim on a
central bank rather than the liability of a private financial
institution” <span class="citation" data-cites="Kosse2023">[<a
href="#ref-Kosse2023" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. This presents
a unique opportunity for interoperability, because much friction in
payment processes is introduced due to the need of converting between
different private instruments with counterparty risk. Even more so, the
literature around CBDC suggests designing it as a bearer instrument,
which gives yet higher flexibility in terms of storage and transmission
of monetary value; an advantage that also applies to wCBDC as compared
to traditional RTGS. For example, transfer of CBDC tokens can be
facilitated in a peer-to-peer fashion, which possibly makes it more
efficient than using existing payment networks. This represents a unique
opportunity to ease fragmentation in the payments ecosystem: CBDC
infrastructure would be a standard right from the start.</p>
<p>This flexibility also introduces a challenge: lack of
standardisation. While many (international) standardisation bodies are
currently engaged in work on CBDC and/or digital assets, there is no
clear picture yet in critical areas, such as wallet and message formats.
Also, there is no consensus yet about which existing standards apply or
can be repurposed for CBDC, for example ISO 20022 (message formats) or
ISO 9362 (business identifier codes). It is not hard to imagine that
this situation could cause widespread fragmentation.</p>
<h2 id="interoperability-domains">Interoperability domains</h2>
<p>In this paper, we focus on connection points between (retail and
wholesale) CBDC vis-à-vis other systems, be they existing or emerging
infrastructure. We discuss those different domains based on a
classification according to the following key criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>unit</strong> is the currency symbol, such as EUR or
USD, or alternatively another asset identifier, such as an
<em>International Securities Identification Number (ISIN)</em> for
securities. For the purpose of this section, we assume that the asset is
fungible and divisible (up to a certain extent) and exclude
<em>non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>issuer</strong> is the entity that manages the supply
of the digital currency; this responsibility includes increasing (or
reducing) currency supply in the economy. For CBDC, the issuer is the
central bank, and the unit would be their jurisdiction’s currency. Other
combinations are possible, e.g., stablecoins that are privately issued
but denominated in a national currency unit.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>platform</strong> is the technical infrastructure
that may or may not be operated by the issuer of the currency. Most
rCBDC platforms will be sovereign national infrastructure, whereas
cross-border CBDCs may be under joint operation by multiple countries.
On the other hand, stablecoins are typically implemented on top of
public blockchains.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Interoperability becomes more challenging, the more of those key
criteria differ. We can now analyse different interoperability domains
based on the key criteria.</p>
<h3 id="existing-instant-payment-systems">Existing instant payment
systems</h3>
<p>According to data from this year, 52% of “central banks regulate or
operate an instant payments system” <em>(IPS)</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="CentralBanking2023">[<a
href="#ref-CentralBanking2023" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>.
Consequently, at least the connection of a domestic IPS with a domestic
CBDC will be a high priority for central banks. While the currency unit
will definitely be the same and the platform will most likely be
different, the situation for the issuer may be unclear. For example,
some countries may choose to delegate CBDC wallet funding and defunding
transactions – effectively an instant payment between (private) deposit
money and central bank money – to the private sector, therefore letting
commercial banks implement individual integrations.</p>
<h3 id="domestic-retail-and-wholesale-cbdc">Domestic retail and
wholesale CBDC</h3>
<p>Should a central bank decide to implement multiple domestic CBDCs,
then unit and issuer will be identical, but their platforms will most
likely differ. To prevent high participants’ costs because of liquidity
requirements on both platforms, central banks should allow for 24/7
seamless funds transfer between systems.</p>
<h3 id="foreign-cbdc">Foreign CBDC</h3>
<p>Considering foreign CBDCs, all key criteria differ. A defining issue
for connecting multiple CBDCs across countries is multi-laterality. In
the classical approach, each pair of currencies needs a dedicated
connection. Mathematically, with 10 different currencies, 45 pairs would
be required.
(There are 45 unique pairings in a set of 10 subjects,
calculated using the formula
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>×</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mo>÷</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n \times (n - 1) \div 2</annotation></semantics></math>.)
Worse, since a central bank
typically cannot manage the foreign-exchange liquidity alone, the
private sector must offer exchange services. (There are exceptions to
this, for example in the case of pegged currencies.) Another model could
improve the situation, with a setup where individual domestic CBDCs
connect to a common cross-border CBDC in a hub-and-spoke fashion (see
figure <a href="#fig:multi-lateral" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:multi-lateral">below</a> for a comparison). Examples for
this approach are “Project Mariana” <span class="citation"
data-cites="BIS2023Mariana">[<a href="#ref-BIS2023Mariana"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span> and “Project mBridge” <span
class="citation" data-cites="BIS2022mBridge">[<a
href="#ref-BIS2022mBridge" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. In
particular, Mariana sought to not only solve multi-laterality on the
technical level, but also the liquidity level.</p>

<figcaption> Two models of multi-laterality. Left: a fully connected
model with all possible pairs. Right: a hub-and-spoke model. For four
countries, a fully connected model requires 6 connections; for 10
countries, the number rises to 45. In the hub-and-spoke model, the
number of connections is always equal to the number of countries.

<h3 id="stablecoins">Stablecoins</h3>
<p>Even though the major stablecoins retain a 1:1 peg to their backing
currency unit, they cannot always guarantee full at-par convertibility.
This means that (often centralized) exchanges are necessary to convert
CBDC to stablecoins, even though their platform might be the same, for
example, if a wCBDC were to be issued on the ERC-20 standard. We
therefore assume that the key criteria unit and issuer will differ to a
domestic CBDC.</p>
<h2 id="technical-interoperability-options">Technical interoperability
options</h2>
<p>Due to the heterogenous interoperability domains, there is no
one-size-fits-all solution. We have identified three technical
interoperability options whose suitability for a given domain depends on
the similarities and differences across the key criteria explained
above:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A <strong>bridge</strong> is a deep, bidirectional connection
between two (or more) systems, where participants can seamlessly
transfer value. For example, a bank could request conversion of a
particular amount
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math>
of rCBDC into the equivalent amount of wCBDC, therefore reducing the
supply of retail CBDC
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>′</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></msub><mo>−</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></semantics></math>)
and increasing the supply of wCBDC
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>M</mi><mi>W</mi><mi>′</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>W</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></semantics></math>).
However, the total circulating CBDC supply stays constant
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>W</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>′</mi></msubsup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>M</mi><mi>W</mi><mi>′</mi></msubsup></mrow></semantics></math>).
This option works especially well if both unit and issuer are the same,
or alternatively if the units have a fixed exchange rate. Of course,
both platforms need to support this kind of value transfer on a
technical level.</p>
<p>Such a connection can be easily operated on a 24/7 basis. But it
should not be considered if the central bank is not in control of the
other system, due to a substantial risk that vulnerabilities in
third-party systems could propagate across bridges <span
class="citation" data-cites="Chainalysis2022">[<a
href="#ref-Chainalysis2022" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>We assume that this option is suitable for the interoperability with
IPS and across domestic CBDC. This could aid commercial banks in their
liquidity management, since they would not need to retain balances or
tokens in two distinct systems, and can exchange monetary value on
demand. For example, if a bank’s customers withdraw more retail CBDC
from their deposit accounts than is currently available in that bank’s
digital vault, it could request an instant conversion from its RTGS
balance.</p></li>
<li><p>An <strong>exchange</strong> is an entity that controls liquidity
of two or more assets that may differ on unit, issuer, and platform,
providing a service that allows participants to trade one asset for
another. In this option, a payment across systems would comprise at
least two transactions: A payer
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math>
pays an amount
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math>
to the exchange
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>E</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math>.
Subsequently, the exchange triggers a payment of an amount
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>y</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math>
based on a pre-determined rate to the payee
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>B</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math>.
Depending on the precise technical design, more parties might be
involved. Independent of that, the total monetary supply on each
individual system stays constant for each transaction.</p>
<p>There are technical measures to make the orchestration more reliable.
Most importantly, the individual transactions should not diverge, i.e.,
one transaction should complete if and only if the other one completes
(so called <em>atomic settlement</em> or <em>atomic swap</em>). This can
be achieved through <em>Hash-Time Lock Contracts (HTLC)</em>, a type of
smart contract that can work across platforms. Though if both systems
use the same platform, <em>Automated Market Makers (AMMs)</em>, another
type of smart contract, can prevent divergence and manage liquidity and
pricing automatically.</p>
<p>An automated, standardized exchange mechanism could solve
multi-laterality. But we note that the foreign-exchange market is
currently highly decentralised, therefore consistent pricing through
smart contracts is not yet achievable. There is active work conducted on
AMM research <span class="citation" data-cites="Bartoletti2022">[<a
href="#ref-Bartoletti2022" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>. Using
AMMs, a hub-and-spoke model can be easily implemented, because there is
a unified liquidity pool across multiple currencies.</p>
<p>This option naturally lends itself to interoperability with foreign
CBDC. It can also be employed for IPS (where no currency conversion is
required) and stablecoins.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>wrapper</strong> is a technical facility where the
central bank or an authorized intermediary would provide a
representation of the CBDC in another system, sharing the same unit. A
conversion request would therefore entail locking or earmarking CBDC
into a dedicated wallet and issuing the same amount on the other system.
Effectively, this would increase the monetary supply since the same
value is now present in two systems. By construction, wrapper solutions
cannot easily work in a hub-and-spoke model.</p>
<p>The challenge with wrappers is that each participant must trust that
the funds are actually locked and can be converted back at any time,
should they so request. Note that stablecoin issuers follow this
approach, but typically, they do not have access to central bank money
to use as collateral.</p>
<p>We foresee that the wrapper option could be used in jurisdictions
where cash issuance is devolved to commercial banks based on strict
reserve criteria imposed by the central bank. Additionally, Project
Mariana, in implementing a multilateral cross-border CBDC, combines an
AMM exchange with domestic rCBDC wrappers (unfortunately also named
“bridge”) <span class="citation" data-cites="BIS2023Mariana">[<a
href="#ref-BIS2023Mariana" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these considerations, it becomes clear that any CBDC design
should take each of those options into account. Fortunately, there is
overlap and technical requirements can be easily incorporated depending
on the use cases.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-equipping-an-ips-with-offline-capability">Case study:
Equipping an IPS with offline capability</h2>
<p><em>Banco Central do Brasil (BCB)</em> has created the instant
payment system <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pix_en">Pix</a>
in 2020, enabling “enables its users
— people, companies and governmental entities — to send or receive
payment transfers in few seconds at any time, including non-business
days.” According to recent statistics, Pix enjoys popularity within
Brazil’s population; with about 3 billion transactions per month. Since
its inception, “the Pix system has been used by more than 140 million
individuals,” which corresponds to “about 80 percent of the adult
population,” as well as 13 million firms <span class="citation"
data-cites="Saiyid2023">[<a href="#ref-Saiyid2023"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>According to the <em>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</em>, some of
the factors contributing to Pix’ success are instant settlement, low
transaction costs, and the central bank acting as infrastructure
provider and regulator <span class="citation"
data-cites="Saiyid2023">[<a href="#ref-Saiyid2023"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>. Those success factors are shared
with the design criteria of an rCBDC. Therefore, a natural question
arises: What could an rCBDC bring to the table, if a domestic IPS is
already popular?</p>
<p>A possible answer is given by examining a shortcoming of Pix: It is
not possible to conduct a transaction without a smartphone or network
connectivity, since Pix only supports online payment processing. This
poses a challenge to resilience, but also to financial inclusion.</p>
<p>To reimagine instant payments with offline capability,
Giesecke+Devrient submitted a proposal to BCB’s “LIFT challenge”, a
broad initiative to further the central bank’s innovation agenda <span
class="citation" data-cites="GD2023">[<a href="#ref-GD2023"
role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Filia<sup>®</sup> is a token-based CBDC that focuses on retail use
cases, such as offline payments, but supports other types of digital
currency as well. It is designed for, but not limited to, a multi-tier
distribution model where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the issuing central bank provides the core infrastructure, such
as the underlying protocol, the backend to assure the integrity of
currency in circulation, as well as mechanisms to govern the CBDC
ecosystem; and</p></li>
<li><p>private sector intermediaries, such as financial service
providers, to provision end user wallets and build innovative services
based on the core technology and regulatory framework provided by the
central bank.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The offline functionality supports payments where both payer and
payee use devices without online connectivity, coined “dual offline” by
BCB. The underlying security model relies on, broadly speaking, secure
hardware, end-to-end encrypted communication channels, and an
industrial-strength public key infrastructure.</p>
<p>In our proposal, we explore how Brazil’s instant payments could be
augmented with Filia<sup>®</sup> offline technology. Users would be
equipped with a secure hardware wallet that is bound to their existing
bank account, and that can manage tokenized offline-transferable money.
We then describe the following scenario, conducted by and end-user
through a mobile app:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>a user transfers bank account money to their offline
wallet</p></li>
<li><p>they use their secure hardware wallet to conduct offline
transactions</p></li>
<li><p>they transfer back their offline value to their bank
account</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This corresponds to an exchange between account-based bank deposit
money and a tokenized rCBDC that is specialized to offline payments.
Notably, there is no need to reflect offline transactions in a bank’s
general ledger, since the tokenized offline money more closely resembles
physical cash, with the mobile app being an “ATM” that supports
withdrawing and depositing tokens. This resemblance also provides a
considerable opportunity: Only the conversion between deposit money and
cash requires a bank account and connectivity, but intermediate
transactions can occur also between individuals without bank accounts.
Most importantly, funds received offline can be immediately respent,
which provides benefits over existing store-value card systems.</p>
<p>The Filia<sup>®</sup> Mobile SDK and backend components are modular
and allow a custom integration into a commercial bank’s (or central
bank’s) system landscape. With them, a bank can implement the
onboarding, (de)funding, and payment flows for secure hardware wallets
in existing mobile apps. Alternatively to an exchange model operated by
commercial banks, our proposal could also be implemented on a central
bank level as a bridge.</p>
<p>Our report concludes that adding offline payments to an IPS
“emphasize[s] the unique value proposition of CBDC [...], such as ease
of use, convenience, enhanced privacy and lower overall costs.”
Therefore, these benefits would “significantly translate to broad user
adoption of a Digital Real in real life payment scenarios.” Finally,
from a user perspective, these “design features could effectively extend
accessibility of digital payments to the 10% of unbanked Brazilians as
well as 11% of those who are underbanked,” providing a real benefit to
economy and society <span class="citation" data-cites="GD2023">[<a
href="#ref-GD2023" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-cross-border-payments-using-an-international-payments-network">Case
study: Cross-border payments using an international payments
network</h2>
<p>As a case study, we will consider a proof of concept implemented in a
joint project by Giesecke+Devrient and the UDPN Alliance <span
class="citation" data-cites="UDPN2023">[<a href="#ref-UDPN2023"
role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span>. The solution connects two products:
the <em>Universal Digital Payments Network (UDPN)</em> platform as the
multilateral cross-border infrastructure and Filia<sup>®</sup> as one
example of a domestic rCBDC platform (see previous section for
details).</p>
<p>The UDPN is a global messaging network supporting
government-regulated digital currency systems, including regulated
stablecoins and CBDCs. It allows any entity to transfer and swap digital
currencies across borders, currencies, and systems in a low-cost and
convenient manner. Technically, it comprises a DLT-based application
layer where smart contracts can be deployed and called for core UDPN
functions (e.g., transfer, swap) and also allows third parties to
innovate and deploy their own smart contract-based value-added services
for functions such as <em>Know Your Customer checks (KYC)</em> or
<em>foreign currency exchange (FX)</em>. Within UDPN, the DLT nodes
validating transactions are operated in a decentralized governance
structure by an industrial consortium of multiple entities. This enables
a hub-and-spoke model where new systems and participants can be
onboarded easily. UDPN relies on the open <em>Decentralised Identifiers
(DID)</em> standard <span class="citation" data-cites="DID">[<a
href="#ref-DID" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> to establish
relationships between entities across different systems.</p>
<p>The goal of the joint project is to connect both systems and enable
bidirectional, peer-to-peer payments across currencies. As a showcase,
we implemented payments from hypothetical EUR (running on
Filia<sup>®</sup>) to INR (running on UDPN) rCBDCs. This included
transfers between end-user wallets, currency conversion, liquidity
management, CBDC issuance, identity, and wallet management.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the prototype, it was decided to employ two
different CBDC issuance models: the hypothetical Digital Euro is issued
in a two-tier model on the Filia<sup>®</sup> platform, and the Digital
Rupee in a synthetic model natively on UDPN. In terms of the above
classification, the prototype is an exchange between two systems with
different units, issuers, and platforms.</p>

<p>The high-level transaction flow for a EUR-to-INR transaction can be
described as follows (figure <a href="#fig:udpn"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:udpn">above</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the Filia<sup>®</sup> app, the first user initiates a
cross-remittance transaction to the second user with the
cross-remittance transaction information: beneficiary unique identifier
(such as registered e-mail ID, phone number, etc.), beneficiary bank,
amount (EUR), etc. The system queries and displays the best FX rate
applicable and receivable in local currency (INR) to the sender to
confirm the cross-border transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>After the first user confirms the transaction, their bank
initiates the EUR transfer from their EUR wallet to the FX Settlement
Bank’s EUR wallet (EUR liquidity pool). The Filia<sup>®</sup> system
will process the payment and return the result to the first user’s
bank.</p></li>
<li><p>The first user’s bank initiates a swap request from EUR to INR by
calling the “Transfer and Swap” smart contract deployed by the FX
Settlement Bank on the UDPN.</p></li>
<li><p>The FX Settlement Bank confirms the status of EUR transaction
result from the Filia<sup>®</sup> payment processor.</p></li>
<li><p>After confirming the transfer, the FX Settlement Bank will
initiate an INR transfer and send the INR from its INR liquidity pool to
the second user’s INR wallet by calling the “eINR Wallet” smart
contract.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the INR transfer is complete, the transaction result will be
synchronized to the participating banks and the “Transfer &amp; Swap”
contract.</p></li>
<li><p>Both users can retrieve the result of the swap transaction from
their respective banking apps with transaction logs, including
timestamps, FX rates, and transaction/service fees (if
applicable).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Key benefits presented by this solution are lower transactions costs,
faster transaction times with 24/7 availability (end-to-end in less than
one minute), settlement in national currencies, improved data sharing
and transparency for all participants (including end-users), and
regulatory compliance. Due to the modular architecture, the prototype
addresses some key hurdles in today’s cross-border transactions. Since
any FX provider can connect to the system, the need for intermediary
credit is eliminated. Furthermore, this reduces the dependence on
intermediaries and correspondent banking, which also increases transfer
speed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have presented several interoperability aspects that any (retail
or wholesale) CBDC design must take into account. Even though CBDC is an
instantly settled liability of the central bank, and even though a
token-based CBDC would allow for great flexibility regarding wallets and
transactions, there are some challenges to prevent it becoming an
insular system. In particular, connection points exist to instant
payment systems, other domestic CBDC, cross-border CBDC, and
stablecoins. There is no single technological means to address all those
connections uniformly. In this paper, we have discussed three broad
options: bridges, exchanges, and wrappers, that each have different use
cases. Given that cross-border payment is currently among the most
severe pain points in the payments ecosystem, we have implemented a
prototype that enables multilateral, peer-to-peer transactions between
countries across currencies. Among the most effective measures to
address the FSB’s goal to enhance cross-border payments, we suggest to
further investigate standardisation and a hub-and-spokes model, both of
which reduce the total complexity of the system.</p>
