title: A conceptual model for point-of-sale payment with Retail CBDC
date: 2024-12-29
---

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is an emerging development in
digital payments, with most central banks worldwide researching,
piloting, or even operating a digital version of cash. A common
definition includes the following characteristics <span class="citation"
data-cites="Hupel2023">[<a href="#ref-Hupel2023"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a digital representation of a country’s or region’s existing
currency,</p></li>
<li><p>issued directly by the central bank,</p></li>
<li><p>usable in electronic payments,</p></li>
<li><p>instantly settled, and</p></li>
<li><p>being legal tender.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, there is a distinction between <em>Retail CBDC</em>,
which can be used by anyone in the jurisdiction, and <em>Wholesale
CBDC</em>, which is only available for regulated financial institutions
<span class="citation" data-cites="Presto2023">[<a
href="#ref-Presto2023" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>. The name
refers to the idea that the former allows for retail payments, whereas
the latter would be used by financial institutions exclusively. This
paper focuses on retail CBDC and investigates how this new instrument
can be used for <em>Point-of-sale (POS) payments</em>.</p>
<h3 id="two-tier-model">Two-tier model</h3>
<p>Users must have a way to interact with the CBDC ecosystem. Most
central banks are exploring a two-tier model, whereby the central bank
acts as the sole issuer of CBDC, but intermediaries—such as commercial
banks, FinTech companies, and other financial institutions—are
responsible for onboarding users and distributing CBDC. In this setting,
intermediaries would provide services to users, according to the rules
set by the central bank and regulators. In other words, central banks
would not be dealing with users directly. This naturally extends to both
consumers and merchants.</p>
<h3 id="wallets-and-payments">Wallets and payments</h3>
<p>To better understand how CBDC payments differ to today’s prevalent
schemes, we first need to look at <em>wallets</em>. In CBDC, they are
combinations of hardware and software that serve as containers of
cryptographic keys. Depending on the CBDC implementation model, the keys
may represent funds directly or serve as credentials to unlock funds
stored elsewhere. Wallets should provide an easy-to-use interface that
allows holders to conduct transactions. Both sides of a transaction
would hold a wallet, and in most CBDC systems, they are symmetric:
customer and merchant wallets differ only in their configuration. This
allows for flexible payment flows, including direct peer-to-peer
transactions. In this way, CBDC wallets resemble physical “cash wallets”
more than other forms of digital wallets (see next paragraph).</p>
<h3 id="public-money-vs.-private-money">Public money vs. private
money</h3>
<p>E-money operators, like PayPal, prepaid credit cards, and mobile
money, are becoming increasingly popular around the world <span
class="citation" data-cites="Sun2023">[<a href="#ref-Sun2023"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. They, too, offer wallets to their
customers. Their underlying instrument is a private form of deposit
money, typically issued by a non-bank financial institution <span
class="citation" data-cites="Wang2022 IMF2018">[<a href="#ref-Wang2022"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a>, <a href="#ref-IMF2018"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>CBDC however, is a direct claim from the user to the central bank,
even in a custodial scenario (see also Table <a href="#tab:types"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:types">1</a>). This means
the CBDC holdings managed by a financial intermediary through custodial
wallets are not represented on that intermediaries’ balance sheet <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bindseil2020">[<a href="#ref-Bindseil2020"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. The situation can be compared to,
for example, securities accounts. In the event of the managing
institution’s insolvency, a user’s holdings are not at risk <span
class="citation" data-cites="Zhao2023">[<a href="#ref-Zhao2023"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>. Consequently, a wallet holder is not
exposed to credit risk from an intermediary, only operational risk <span
class="citation" data-cites="CliffordChance">[<a
href="#ref-CliffordChance" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>For this reason, CBDC payments behave differently from private
payment rails because there is no need for a (typically deferred)
settlement step. CBDC could change the role of acquirers, with small
businesses potentially opting to accept CBDC directly on their own
devices without intermediaries.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-this-paper">Structure of this paper</h3>
<p>I will first introduce the concept of CBDC wallets and discuss their
different types (Section <a href="#design-of-cbdc-wallets"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="design-of-cbdc-wallets">2</a>), focusing on their design
and form factors (Section <a href="#wallet-form-factors"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="wallet-form-factors">2.4</a>).
Then, I will explain two methods for initiating payment, namely pull and
push, and how they relate to POS payments (Section <a
href="#payment-initiation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="payment-initiation">3</a>). This includes an overview of
technical communication channels to execute a payment (Section <a
href="#communication-channels-at-the-point-of-sale"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="communication-channels-at-the-point-of-sale">3.1</a>).
Finally, I will develop a conceptual model of POS payments, considering
the unique characteristics of a retail CBDC (Section <a
href="#payment-model-for-cbdc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="payment-model-for-cbdc">4</a>).</p>
<h2 id="design-of-cbdc-wallets">Design of CBDC wallets</h2>
<p>In cryptocurrencies and CBDC, wallets are the primary point of
interaction between users and the system. While ample studies exist on
the former, CBDC wallets are not yet widely investigated in the
literature. Fortunately, wallets for both domains share similar traits:
They manage cryptographic keys that unlock funds and enable users to
transact.</p>
<p>Wallets are the primary way for customers to initiate payments and
for merchants to accept payments, therefore they play a critical role at
the point of sale. This means that their design is affected by the
interaction of hardware, software, UI/UX, security, and the physical
environment in which they are used.</p>
<p>CBDC, being a new form of public money, increases flexibility for
customers and merchants, providing them with more choices and,
therefore, fostering competition. The flip side is that now, many more
payment scenarios must be accommodated in the already crowded space.</p>
<h3 id="wallet-types">Wallet types</h3>
<p>As a starting point, we can categorize wallets across the three
dimensions relevant to this paper: custody <span class="citation"
data-cites="Froehlich2020 Yu2024">[<a href="#ref-Froehlich2020"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a>, <a href="#ref-Yu2024"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>, embodiment, and offline capability
<span class="citation" data-cites="BISPolaris1">[<a
href="#ref-BISPolaris1" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span> (see
table <a href="#tab:types" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:types">below</a>).</p>
<p>Naturally, the design choices of the overall system, such as the
ledger, influences which wallet types are supported for a given CBDC.
Yet, this is not an exact 1:1 mapping, so multiple wallet types might
coexist in the same ecosystem, as evidenced by the vast number of wallet
implementations for cryptocurrencies <span class="citation"

</figure>
<h3 id="the-special-case-of-offline-capability">The special case of
offline capability</h3>
<p>One of the most important motivations for CBDC adoption is offline
capability. Many central banks investigating or implementing retail CBDC
consider offline capabilities to be an important feature, including for
the European Central Bank’s Digital Euro <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kiff2022 Demertzis2023 Panetta2021">[<a href="#ref-Kiff2022"
role="doc-biblioref">13</a>–<a href="#ref-Panetta2021"
role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Today, payments can be made when both parties are offline, for
example, with credit cards. Yet, there are two major differences to
CBDC:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Credit cards face settlement risk because there may be a few days
between payment initiation and the actual transfer of funds. CBDC would
be settled instantly and irrevocably.</p></li>
<li><p>Credit cards are prone to double spending, where users spend more
funds than they have available. This is by design: the risk is born by
the card issuer, who charges interest. CBDC, being more like cash, does
not have credit features and must therefore carefully protect against
double spending <span class="citation" data-cites="Kahn2021">[<a
href="#ref-Kahn2021" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Applying this to the terminology from above, existing payment schemes
only support a weak form of staged offline payments. In contrast,
central banks typically aim for at least intermittently offline payment
capability. Implementations would reuse existing technology, such as
hardware secure elements, to protect against double spending.</p>
<p>This is enabled by designing the CBDC to transfer value directly from
one wallet to another.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Because CBDC wallets are symmetric,
a basic merchant acceptance device could be independent of any acquirer
and accept a peer-to-peer payment from a customer, just like cash today
<span class="citation" data-cites="BOGDesignPaper">[<a
href="#ref-BOGDesignPaper" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span>.</p>
<h3 id="coexistence-of-online-and-offline-wallets">Coexistence of online
and offline wallets</h3>
<p>While some CBDC technology platforms cater exclusively to fully
offline operation, with no possibility of using custodial and/or online
wallets, the consensus among central banks is that both online and
offline operations are desirable.</p>
<p>Consequently, a user could hold multiple wallets, some of them purely
for online purposes and some others for (optional) offline use. This
mirrors the current financial system, where online balances are held as
deposit money in commercial banks, and offline “balances” are held as
cash. In CBDC, a user could allocate their funds across different
wallets. This could be frictionless, since moving money from one digital
wallet to another could be facilitated through, for example, a
smartphone, and would not require a trip to an ATM.</p>
<p>Applied to the point of sale, the smartphone used by the customer
could represent multiple wallets. The Bank for International Settlements
points out that it “is important that any online balances and offline
balances are segregated, otherwise it may be possible for a user to
spend the same value both offline and online and create a double-spend
risk” <span class="citation" data-cites="BISPolaris1">[<a
href="#ref-BISPolaris1" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. Therefore,
picking the correct wallet that sends the payment matters.</p>
<p>Obviously, this impacts the user experience at points of sale. In
Section <a href="#payment-model-for-cbdc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="payment-model-for-cbdc">4</a>, I describe the necessary
setup for such wallet negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="wallet-form-factors">Wallet form factors</h3>
<figure id="fig:wallets">
  <img src="{% link assets/img/research/cbdc-pos/wallets.drawio.svg %}" alt="">
<figcaption>Various CBDC wallet form factors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>CBDC wallets can come in many forms, evidenced by the existing CBDC
proof of concept and pilot projects. The figure <a href="#fig:wallets"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:wallets">above</a> provides
some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A smartphone, equipped with a wallet app. This app could either
access a custodial wallet managed by a user’s preferred intermediary, or
funds that are stored in secure hardware directly on the device (e.g.,
an embedded secure element or a SIM card <span class="citation"
data-cites="Reuver2017">[<a href="#ref-Reuver2017"
role="doc-biblioref">18</a>]</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>A dedicated and/or wearable device with a limited user interface,
interacting through NFC. Examples include wristbands, smartcards,
smartwatches, and keyfobs.</p></li>
<li><p>A merchant acceptance device. Examples include portable
NFC/Bluetooth card readers that connect to a smartphone and dedicated
POS terminals that may be based on a standard mobile operating system
like Android. Because of CBDC’s symmetric nature, the merchant device
could itself be (i.e., contain) a wallet.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, any form factor can work in a dual mode: (1) using funds
stored directly on the device—which admits offline payments—or (2)
serving as a strong authentication mechanism towards a custodial
wallet.</p>
<p>In the first <em>(peer)</em> mode, the value transfer is directly
executed between two devices. In the second <em>(authentication)</em>
mode, the value transfer is authorized by the customer’s device, but
executed from the customer’s custodial wallet.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
This means that the card merely serves as a vehicle to authenticate the
user to their intermediary.</p>
<p>Offline wallets capable of peer mode are comparable to physical cash
wallets. They would also be available for individuals (e.g. children or
tourists) without a bank account in the domestic currency.</p>
<h3 id="comparison-to-existing-pos-payment-schemes">Comparison to
existing POS payment schemes</h3>
<p>Current card payment schemes support all of the above form factors,
but they can only operate in authentication mode. Traditionally, this
was the reason for their delayed settlement since the flow of funds was
not triggered immediately after authentication. Modern
account-to-account (A2A) payment eliminates this disadvantage by relying
on instant payment transfers in the backend.<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
Still, neither allows for (at least) intermittently offline payments
that are instantly settled.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the traditional world of bank accounts and bank transfers,
initiation of the flow of funds can come from two different directions
(figure <a href="#fig:direction" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:direction">above</a>; <span class="citation"
data-cites="GoCardless">[<a href="#ref-GoCardless"
role="doc-biblioref">22</a>]</span>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A standard bank transfer flows from the sender’s bank account to
the receiver’s. This is referred to as a <em>push payment</em> because
the sender triggers it. Standing orders are also push-based, as are
payments in cash.</p></li>
<li><p>The receiver can also initiate the fund transfer: A direct debit
(also known as debit order) is an example of a <em>pull payment</em>.
Checks can also be classified as pull; even though the payer signs
checks, the payee triggers the actual transfer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both directions have advantages and disadvantages. Yet, there is a
trend towards push payments at the point of sale. One factor driving
this are mobile payments, which often use merchant QR codes that
customers scan with their mobile devices <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sun2023">[<a href="#ref-Sun2023"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Many of these schemes operate as A2A and support instant settlement.
They experience rapid user adoption, for example Pix in Brazil <span
class="citation" data-cites="Saiyid2023">[<a href="#ref-Saiyid2023"
role="doc-biblioref">23</a>]</span>, UPI in India, and Swish in Sweden
<span class="citation" data-cites="Hartmann2019">[<a
href="#ref-Hartmann2019" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>]</span>. Other
countries with a higher market share of debit and credit card payments,
for example the United States, are slower to catch on <span
class="citation" data-cites="Dresner2024">[<a href="#ref-Dresner2024"
role="doc-biblioref">25</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Pull payments are often associated with settlement delay credit. This
is why in the context of CBDC, most central banks only consider push.<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In other words, funds flow from
wallet to wallet at the request of the payer.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that push payments in retail CBDC are most
relevant at the point of sale. They could be designed in both the peer
and authentication modes. Conversely, pull payments would not be able to
work in peer mode.</p>
<h3 id="communication-channels-at-the-point-of-sale">Communication
channels at the point of sale</h3>
<p>Zooming in on physical merchant locations, this section describes the
technical communication channels that are available at the points of
sale, i.e., for proximity payments. For simplicity, I will also assume
that the merchant has a “smart” acceptance device, which may come in the
form of a standalone POS terminal or a smartphone.</p>
<p>Equipped with such a device, a merchant has the following options to
accept a payment:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A smart card can be inserted into a card reader, e.g., of a
standalone POS terminal or a mobile reader connected to a phone via
Bluetooth.</p></li>
<li><p>A smart card or other mobile and/or wearable device can be
touched via NFC.</p></li>
<li><p>A merchant-presented QR code (either static or dynamic) can be
scanned by the customer with their smartphone.</p></li>
<li><p>A customer-presented QR code (either static or dynamic) can be
scanned by the merchant with their POS terminal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Debit and credit cards mostly focus on the first two (with merchant-
and customer-presented QR code payment specified by <span
class="citation" data-cites="EMVCo">[<a href="#ref-EMVCo"
role="doc-biblioref">27</a>]</span>). The actual payment gets
transmitted through a card network. Conversely, A2A schemes mostly rely
on merchant-presented QR code, which contain the merchant’s account or
wallet number. The customer’s app then initiates a fund transfer to that
account.</p>
<p>No existing payment scheme uses any of the communication channels
available at the point of sale for actual fund transfer. This is
delegated to backend processes at a suitable intermediary, either the
customer’s own bank (like in A2A schemes), or the merchant’s acquirer
(like in debit and credit card schemes).</p>
<p>This is where retail CBDC provides a new technological opportunity:
NFC and Bluetooth could unify payment initiation and execution.<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The next section develops a
conceptual model how this payment scenario can coexist with other
traditional methods, as well as how QR codes could be leveraged for CBDC
payments.</p>
<h2 id="payment-model-for-cbdc">Payment model for CBDC</h2>
<p>To summarize, the earlier sections of this paper have established</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the fundamental characteristics of a retail CBDC, as an
instantly-settled payment instrument that is a direct liability of the
central bank, and therefore carries no counterparty risk;</p></li>
<li><p>distinguishing characteristics of retail CBDC vs. other
instruments, and its similarity to cash;</p></li>
<li><p>different wallet types and consumer choice, including the option
for offline payments with direct value transfer between wallets;
and</p></li>
<li><p>the higher relevance of push payments vs. pull payments at the
point of sale.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this, the remainder of this paper introduces an existing
mechanism to distinguish between different payment options at the point
of sale and enhances this concept to enable CBDC payments.</p>
<h3 id="consumer-choice-and-complexity">Consumer choice and
complexity</h3>
<p>As discussed earlier, users will have ample choices about wallet form
factors. For example, they may choose to only use custodial services
through an intermediary, only use a smart card, or a combination
thereof. In developed economies, it is likely that users may opt for a
smartphone to access their various wallets.</p>
<p>This poses a challenge for UI/UX design. Imagine a customer wanting
to pay at a store with their smartphone. On the smartphone, they may
have a banking app as well as a credit card (e.g., in Apple Pay), a CBDC
wallet app, and additionally offline CBDC holdings stored on the
smartphone (e.g., in the SIM card). The customer now faces the choice to
pick the appropriate payment channel. Both parties may have (diverging)
preferences: The customer may prefer to use their credit card due to
cashback and the merchant may prefer to accept CBDC due to lower fees. A
similar issue arises should the customer present a smart card with
multiple co-badged schemes.</p>

<figcaption>Application selection: negotiating a payment scheme between
customer and merchant device based on the <em>Application Identifier
(AID)</em>, which uniquely identifies the payment scheme</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is not a new problem. Domestic and international card schemes
co-exist today on shared infrastructure, i.e., customer cards and
merchant terminals. In a process known as <em>Application Selection</em>
<span class="citation" data-cites="Struif1995">[<a
href="#ref-Struif1995" role="doc-biblioref">28</a>]</span>, mutually
supported schemes, then select from that list based on prioritization on
the customer’s card (see figure <a href="#fig:aid"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:aid">above</a>).</p>
<p>In the prevailing payment landscape, these complexities are well
understood. Current technology provides sufficient flexibility to
integrate new payment schemes. CBDC could therefore be seamlessly
integrated, although certain specialties must be considered. This mainly
concerns offline payment, which is discussed in this section. Note that
this technology can run on cheap commodity smartphones and on existing
POS terminals, limiting merchants’ need to invest into additional
hardware.</p>
<h3 id="contact-and-contactless-nfc-payments">Contact and contactless
(NFC) payments</h3>
<p>Setting aside QR code payments for now, CBDC would introduce two new
applications corresponding to the transfer modes discussed above: direct
value transfer between wallets (peer mode) and authentication towards a
custodial wallet (authentication mode).</p>
<p>In practice, however, the peer mode is vastly different from existing
payment schemes: they were not designed for direct value transfer.
Additionally, it would be capable of offline payments.</p>
<p>The Bank of England, in a POS feasibility study, has investigated
this flow (among others) <span class="citation" data-cites="BOEPOS">[<a
href="#ref-BOEPOS" role="doc-biblioref">29</a>]</span>. They define the
peer mode to be “a payment <span>[</span>…<span>]</span> made between
two devices without network connection, supporting offline payments.”
Note that this leaves open whether the payment recipient is a merchant
or any other CBDC wallet holder.</p>
<p>The Bank’s study found that the existing EMV applications “were not
appropriate for storing offline balances.” To transact with those
offline balances, the Bank had to implement new software running on the
customer device, as well as “a new kernel <span>[</span>on the
terminals<span>]</span> that could interact with it” <span
class="citation" data-cites="BOEPOS">[<a href="#ref-BOEPOS"
role="doc-biblioref">29</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This result highlights that CBDC presents a new means of payment that
enables more use cases, beyond what is available in the market today.
Merchants could decide whether to accept payments to a hardware wallet
contained in a smartphone or POS terminal or forward them to a custodial
wallet. This selection can also happen dynamically depending on the
availability of an online connection, but it could also be influenced by
regulatory considerations.</p>
<p>Despite the broad agreement that CBDC should enable such offline
payments, there is little progress towards standardization. This may be
caused by the fact that the implementation of an offline CBDC payment
protocol is highly sensitive to the design decisions about the overall
CBDC system, which differ widely across countries.</p>
<p>Conversely, the authentication mode can work similarly to existing
payment schemes. One of the five lots of the Digital Euro tender,
entitled <em>Secure Exchange of Payment Information</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="ECBTokenisation Vahter2024">[<a
href="#ref-ECBTokenisation" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>, <a
href="#ref-Vahter2024" role="doc-biblioref">31</a>]</span>, is likely to
deal with this.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank has not shared any more details yet. It is
plausible though that a card-initiated CBDC payment could mimic an A2A
payment, with the customer’s card carrying authentication information
towards their custodial CBDC wallet. As the study by the Bank of England
demonstrated, this could be compatible with existing EMV kernels <span
class="citation" data-cites="BOEPOS">[<a href="#ref-BOEPOS"
role="doc-biblioref">29</a>]</span>.</p>

<figcaption>Exemplary payment journey for contact and

</figure>
<p>The figure above shows a possible payment
journey. The following steps are executed:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Customer presents a payment device, such as a smartcard.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer device and merchant terminal negotiate mode, resulting
in either (a) peer or (b) authentication mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The flow branches:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In peer mode (illustrated in red) ...</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The merchant terminal instructs the customer’s hardware wallet
contained in the smartcard to initiate a peer payment.</p></li>
<li><p>The customer’s wallet transfers funds offline to the merchant’s
wallet contained in the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, the terminal can later (or immediately) forward the
funds to the merchant’s custodial wallet. <a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In authentication mode (illustrated in green) ...</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The merchant terminal contacts the customer’s bank, forwards
authentication information, and initiates a payment. <a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The customer’s bank transfer funds online from the customer’s
custodial wallet to the merchant’s custodial wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>The merchant’s bank notifies the terminal that the payment is
completed.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>There is no clear picture yet of how a mode would be selected. In
addition to preferences configured by the customer’s device, either by
the issuer or the user directly, the following considerations might come
into play:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>availability of online connection (in case both parties are
offline, then payments must be executed directly between hardware
wallets);</p></li>
<li><p>local regulation regarding acceptance limits (non-merchants may
only be allowed to accept some maximum amount offline to prevent money
laundering); and</p></li>
<li><p>presence of secure hardware in the POS terminal (NFC-enabled
cheap smartphones may not have the necessary technology to accept
offline payments).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, because online and offline CBDC balances are segregated, it
seems clear that offline payments should serve as a fallback option.
Otherwise, users may be forced to top up their hardware wallet
frequently.</p>
<p>Depending on the form factor, the UI/UX can be designed to require
little user intervention at the point of sale. Take Apple Pay: users can
set a default card that is used when the side button is pressed.
Physical cards do not allow this flexibility.</p>
<p>For merchants, the trade-off is similar. Due to associated high
risks, they may not be interested in holding large offline balances in
their device. As described above, should the device break, their income
would be lost. The European Central Bank has clarified that businesses
have a “zero daily holding limit” of Digital Euro, with only “intraday
holdings possible” <span class="citation" data-cites="ECBOnboarding">[<a
href="#ref-ECBOnboarding" role="doc-biblioref">32</a>]</span>, albeit
not for technical, but rather regulatory reasons.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale terminals may need to be upgraded to consider dynamic
factors in Application Selection. From the consumer side, the central
bank could provide sensible defaults: e.g., on a smartphone, to use
online payments whenever possible. This should prevent overburdening
users with choice. Combined with an auto-top up feature where a minimum
balance on a hardware wallet is maintained, this could enable a
frictionless payment experience. Additionally, regulation and lower
transaction fees could lead to CBDC being preferred over debit and
credit card schemes in the market.</p>
<h3 id="qr-code-payments">QR code payments</h3>
<p>Payments with merchant-provided QR codes are easy to implement,
provided no offline support is required. This approach closely follows
A2A payments.</p>
<figure id="fig:journey-qr">
  <img src="{% link assets/img/research/cbdc-pos/user-journeys-QR.drawio.png %}" alt="">
<figcaption>Exemplary payment journey for QR codes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To accept a CBDC payment, the merchant’s POS device could generate a
dynamic QR code containing the merchant’s wallet address, the amount,
and a unique transaction ID. The customer scans the code and initiates
the transaction through their wallet app.</p>
<p>Fortunately, adding a QR code payment option can be designed
unobtrusively. A suitable POS terminal can display a QR code and wait
for an NFC connection simultaneously. The customer simply chooses to do
one or the other. Should the merchant not have online connectivity—for
example, because of an outage—the QR code would not be displayed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the customer’s behavior (by scanning a QR code) directly
and unambiguously selects the payment flow.</p>
<p>But this assumes that only one QR code standard is in use in a
country and that that standard has either been purposely designed or has
been made compatible with CBDC. Already in 2021, the World Bank has
identified a “proliferation of QR codes in the market, harming
compatibility and customer experience” <span class="citation"
data-cites="WorldBank Naess2022">[<a href="#ref-WorldBank"
role="doc-biblioref">21</a>, <a href="#ref-Naess2022"
role="doc-biblioref">33</a>]</span>. As a solution, they suggest
harmonization, for example, by central banks taking a national approach.
This has been conducted successfully in the Bank of Thailand’s retail
CBDC pilot, which also tested offline payments <span class="citation"
data-cites="BOT">[<a href="#ref-BOT"
role="doc-biblioref">34</a>]</span>.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>David Birch, a financial services advisor, agrees that “CBDCs have to
work offline” and asks, “why not make all of the transactions offline so
that there are no scaling issues?” Birch argues that this would simplify
the “whole design and implementation” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Birch2024LinkedIn">[<a href="#ref-Birch2024LinkedIn"
role="doc-biblioref">35</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This may be true from a technical perspective. But it is also not a
silver bullet: there are additional non-technical arguments why online
and offline payments will co-exist well into the future. They represent
the fundamental trade-off between accessibility and resilience. An
online balance can be easily accessed through multiple devices, and
device loss does not imply loss of funds. For offline balances, it is
the exact opposite.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Even today, many POS terminals support a dozen different card payment
schemes, domestic and international. With no standardized cross-border
retail CBDC on the horizon, there is little chance of domestic CBDC
crowding out major card networks.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, imperative that a retail CBDC design integrates
into the existing payment landscape. A well-designed point-of-sale
experience can avoid the impression of fragmentation while still
realizing efficiency gains provided by instant settlement and low
transaction fees.</p>
<p>An interesting side effect of the CBDC technology is that the peer
payment mode could also be provided in non-proximity situations. Direct
value transfer not only works via NFC or Bluetooth but could also be
conveyed through 4G or Wi-Fi networks. Birch calls this “edge
transactions”.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that retail CBDC is moving forward, with the
Digital Euro currently being one of the most prominent projects. The
European Central Bank clarified that offline capability and merchant
payments are within the scope of the Digital Euro. Similarly, the Bank
of England has investigated point-of-sale payments through a proof of
concept, analyzing the implementation of three different payment modes
<span class="citation" data-cites="BOEPOS">[<a href="#ref-BOEPOS"
role="doc-biblioref">29</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Globally, the Bank for International Settlements observes that
“throughout 2023, both retail and wholesale CBDC work progressed to more
advanced stages” <span class="citation" data-cites="DiIorio2024">[<a
href="#ref-DiIorio2024" role="doc-biblioref">36</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This has led to user adoption becoming an increased focus of
research. Yet, as Lin and Chen point out, “there is a gap in the
research on CBDC consumer adoption and its UX” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lin2023">[<a href="#ref-Lin2023"
role="doc-biblioref">37</a>]</span>. Within that small body, there is
even less treatment of POS payments <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lin2023 Lin2023a Lin2023b Abramova2022">[<a
href="#ref-Lin2023" role="doc-biblioref">37</a>–<a
href="#ref-Abramova2022" role="doc-biblioref">40</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This paper sought to contribute a conceptual model for the
interaction between customers and merchants through CBDC wallets.
Because wallets can work both online and offline, they can contribute to
increased resilience and financial inclusion. Instant settlement and
CBDC being a central bank liability also reduce risk and enable more
flexible payment scenarios. The model can also be applied to other forms
of tokenized monies, such as stablecoins or tokenized deposits.</p>
<p>However, this also leads to an increase in complexity. To some
extent, this can be alleviated by leveraging existing standards (e.g.,
EMV for authentication mode), which are suitable for online CBDC
payments. QR codes can also be offered unobtrusively by integrating CBDC
wallet addresses into domestic or international QR code standards.</p>
<p>The remaining challenge is the user experience for offline payments.
I have presented an approach based on the existing Application Selection
mechanism of POS terminals to automatically select the source of funds,
depending on static and dynamic factors. This does not prevent
tech-savvy users from defining their preferences. On the merchant side,
smartphones could also serve as acceptance devices, lowering the barrier
to conduct business.</p>
<p>The burden is on central banks and technology providers to adequately
weigh technological trade-offs and provide reasonable defaults. However,
more research is needed to understand user behavior when confronted with
new payment methods. This is necessary to foster user adoption and to
ensure that retail CBDC becomes successful.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The Bank for International Settlements chooses a
slightly different categorization, borrowing terminology from the
cryptocurrency community: “A cold wallet is a hardware device and can be
operated offline, while a hot wallet is an online service based on web
resources (and can be operated only by online users)” <span
class="citation" data-cites="BISPolaris1">[<a href="#ref-BISPolaris1"

<li id="fn3"><p>This mode illustrates why the term “wallet” is
ambiguous. The actual funds reside in a custodial wallet managed by an
intermediary on a remote server. But the customer uses a “wallet app” to
access those funds.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn12"><p>If the merchant terminal does not have hardware
capabilities to operate a hardware wallet, the peer payment could also
directly flow to the merchant’s custodial wallet. The terminal would
merely act as a communication proxy. This would be steered through the
terminal and would therefore be transparent to the customer’s device.<a

shows a direct communication channel between terminal and the customer’s

acquirer. For example, the Bank of England study investigated two
different communication pathways: one through the central bank and one
through the merchant’s bank <span class="citation"
