This page does not store cookies (see <a href="{% link about.md %}#cookies-and-stuff">here for details</a>).
But I know that a lot of my visitors really like cookies.
This is why I put a cookie here:
🍪
<p>Feel free to use it however you like.</p>
<p>For your convenience, you can even click this button to copy a cookie to your clipboard:</p>
<p><button onclick="copyCookie();">Copy 🍪 to clipboard</button></p>
