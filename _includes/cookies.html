This page does not store cookies (see <a href="/about">here for details</a>).
But I know that a lot of my visitors really like cookies.
This is why I put a cookie here:
🍪
<br>
Feel free to use it however you like.

For your convenience, you can even click this button to copy a cookie to your clipboard:

<button onclick="copyCookie();">Copy 🍪 to clipboard</button>
