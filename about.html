    <p>I enjoy programming, cycling, travelling, dogs, and conferences.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Standing invitation.</strong>
      If you want to talk research or software, I want to talk to you.
      My email addresses &amp; social media handles can be found <a href="/">here</a>.
      Email is much preferred. Unless it's urgent, avoid calling me (I prefer async communication).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>I like getting email.</em>
        I enjoy both friends and strangers emailing me.
        I usually reply and quickly.
        If not, feel free to poke me again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>I like conferences.</em>
        If you recognize me at a conference, come talk to me.
        I won't bite.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>I like meeting people.</em>
        If you're around my home town, Munich, hit me up.
        Let's arrange a meeting, maybe over tea: I'm happy to talk.
        If you follow me on Twitter, you'll have noticed that I usually announce my trips &amp; geo-tag my tweets on trips.
        If we're at the same place somewhere abroad, the same applies as for Munich.
      </li>
    </ul>
