<p>I enjoy programming, cycling, travelling, dogs, and conferences.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Standing invitation.</strong>
  If you want to talk research or software, I want to talk to you.
  My email addresses &amp; social media handles can be found <a href="/">here</a>.
  Email is much preferred. Unless it's urgent, avoid calling me (I prefer async communication).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>I like getting email.</em>
    I enjoy both friends and strangers emailing me.
    I usually reply and quickly.
    If not, feel free to poke me again.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>I like conferences.</em>
    If you recognize me at a conference, come talk to me.
    I won't bite.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>I like meeting people.</em>
    If you're around my home town, Munich, hit me up.
    Let's arrange a meeting, maybe over tea: I'm happy to talk.
    If you follow me on Twitter, you'll have noticed that I usually announce my trips &amp; geo-tag my tweets on trips.
    If we're at the same place somewhere abroad, the same applies as for Munich.
  </li>
</ul>
