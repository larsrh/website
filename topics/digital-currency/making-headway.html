<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has just published
a new report on CBDC & cryptoassets, entitled “<a href=
"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.pdf">Making headway – Results of the 2022 BIS survey on central
bank digital currencies and crypto</a>”. The report is based on a
“survey of 86 central banks conducted in late 2022”. While the
focus is firmly on CBDC, there is another aspect in the report that
I would like to highlight: the (dis)use of stablecoins in the real
economy.</p>
<p>To quote BIS: “Apart from being used in decentralised finance
(DeFi) and crypto trading, stablecoins are hardly used for payments
outside the crypto ecosystem.”</p>
<p>What does that mean? Obviously, the role of stablecoins like
Tether in crypto asset trading is indisputable. In ECB’s
macroprudential bulletin (18/2022), <a href=
"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_2~836f682ed7.en.html"
>Adachi et al. have found</a> that the “largest
existing stablecoin, Tether, has already become critical in
crypto-asset trading”. One source puts Tether at <a href=
"https://finbold.com/tether-dominates-centralized-exchange-stablecoin-trade-volumes-despite-market-cap-decline/"
>around 70% of all reported trading volume</a> on
exchanges (as of 2022). Furthermore, transaction volume of
stablecoins on centralized exchanges dwarfs on-chain transactions,
which are used for example when buying or selling NFTs.</p>
<p>But why have stablecoins failed to find significant use as a
means of payment in the real economy? Usually, their relative
(in)stability comes to mind, caused by the inherent risks of assets
that back stablecoin. The value of those assets, e.g., commodities
and treasury bills, can fall dramatically within a short period of
time. Many articles have been written about that. However, there is
a more significant problem with their use in retail payments: high
transaction fees.</p>
<p>The reason for that problem is quite simple. Most of the popular
stablecoins are based on Ethereum or comparable public blockchains,
which are notorious for volatile fees. Adachi <em>et al.</em>
summarize the situation as follows: “Stablecoins fall short of what
is required of practical means of payment for the real
economy”.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01392.pdf"
>study of on-chain Tether transactions</a> in 2022Q1 has
found a median gas price of 75.5 Gwei, which translates into $13.
To quote: “Only 4.2% of fees are under the average $3.08 fee for
out-of-network ATM transactions”. Even worse, for a reported 1.78%
of transactions, fees exceed the transferred value. The author
identifies a trend of rising gas prices, perhaps because of an
increased popularity of Ethereum. Even if users switch to other,
less busy blockchain platforms, they may face other issues, such as
<a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dlt-necessary-build-cbdc-part-3-dr-lars-hupel/"
>decreased resilience</a> against double-spending
attacks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the use of blockchain-based stablecoins so far does
not appear to offer material advantages over existing payment
schemes (Adachi <em>et al.</em>), perhaps because public
blockchains have inherent scalability issues.</p>
<p>This perhaps gives a better idea about why the BIS report
concludes that stablecoins are used outside of crypto assets only
by “niche groups”, with cross-border remittances being by far the
most popular, and consumer goods and services insignificant. This
gap could be closed by CBDC, which is technologically more suitable
for retail purposes.</p>
