<p>In my <a href=
"{% link topics/digital-currency/wallet.html %}"
>last article</a>, I made an attempt at defining the
concept of a wallet, as well as categorizing the different contents
of a wallet. To recap, I used the metaphors of <em>vouchers</em>
and <em>credentials</em>: A credential represents an aspect of
<em>who you are</em>, whereas a voucher represents an aspect of
<em>what you possess</em>. On this abstract level, a wallet is a
container of secret keys that may be used as vouchers or
credentials. Often, those represent or enable access to money.</p>
<p>But let us get more concrete (and technical) now. When talking
about wallets, tokens are not far away. At the risk of repeating
myself, but … just like in wallets, there are truly mind-bogglingly
many different interpretations of the concept of a <em>token</em>.
High time to shed some light on it.</p>
<h2>Hardware or software?</h2>
<p>The first question that we need to answer: with tokens, do we
mean <em>hardware</em> or <em>software</em> tokens?</p>
<p>As it turns out, hardware tokens (or security tokens) have been
around for a long time. Those are small, special purpose devices
that are used for authentication purposes. For example, they may
have a small display that shows a 6-digit code that changes every
minute. When logging into a website, the server asks for this code,
the user looks at the device and types the code into the browser. A
particularly popular brand of such devices, manufactured by RSA
(the company, not the algorithm), has been around since at least
2002.</p>

</figure>
<p>Modern security tokens serve the same purpose, but can be
connected directly to a computer, for example via NFC or Bluetooth.
In fact, such a token is also sold by G+D: the <a href=
"https://www.gi-de.com/en/digital-security/identity-technology/enterprise-security/hardware-based-authentication/starsign-key-fob"
>StarSign® Key Fob</a> (see picture). As an
additional security feature, the Key Fob requires a fingerprint to
unlock.</p>
<p>As I have explained in the former article, there may be hardware
devices that store cryptographic secret keys representing monetary
value. Therefore, in the context of digital currencies, we should
stay away from the term “token” to refer to such devices. Instead,
let us stick to the more apt term <em>hardware wallet</em>.</p>
<h2>Tokens in computer science</h2>
<p>Even if we disregard hardware tokens and only consider software,
the term “token” is still overloaded. According to a definition by
<a href=
"https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html"
>Manning <em>et al.</em></a>, a “<em>token</em> is an
instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document
that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for
processing”. All clear? Absolutely not. Why? Because the meaning of
“token” even depends on the particular sub-discipline of computer
science!</p>
<p>What I just cited comes from a book on information retrieval,
where a computer tries to make sense of languages, both the natural
and the programming varieties. You may have stumbled over “token”
in the sense of “a bunch of characters or words” in the context of
<em>Large Language Models (LLMs)</em>, which split up inputs – for
example, an English sentence – into small, meaningful units.</p>
<p>Clearly, that has nothing to do with tokens in digital
currencies. So, let us zoom in there.</p>
<h2>Tokens as surrogates</h2>
<p>According to <a href=
"https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/payment-tokenization-guide"
>another definition</a>, “<em>tokenization</em> is a
process of replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive ones”. Now
we are getting closer to the crux of the matter.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="{% link assets/img/topics/digital-currency/token/Credit_card_imprinter.jpg %}" alt="Mechanical credit card imprinter">
<figcaption>Remember these things?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The best way to understand tokenization in this context is to
look at credit cards. As I discussed in the last article, credit
cards are – if you excuse the gross simplification – credentials
whose only purpose is to transmit your <em>Primary Account
Number</em> (<em>PAN</em> for short: the number embossed on the
card) to the acquiring bank via the merchant’s point of sales
terminal. While you are busy packing away the goods that you have
just purchased, the acquiring bank uses the PAN to find the issuing
bank, i.e., your bank, which confirms the transaction, and
ultimately allows the acquiring bank to pull funds from your
account. This is how credit cards have worked for decades, even
when merchants still had to copy your PAN onto carbon paper using a
knuckle-buster.</p>
<p>This has worked very well for legitimate payments, but
unfortunately, also for illegitimate payments. If merchants can
draw funds from your account by mere knowledge of your PAN, who
prevents fraudsters from doing the same?</p>
<p>This is where tokenization in payment schemes come in. To
continue with the above definition: “Tokenized payments are
payments in which a token substitutes the PAN.” In this context,
you can think of a payment token as a random number that sort of
looks like a PAN but may be restricted in use: only for one use,
only for a single merchant, only for a maximum amount of money, …
you get the idea. (Once again, we have such products in our
portfolio: for example, the <a href=
"https://www.gi-de.com/en/financial-platforms/trusted-software/digital-payment-solutions/convego-token-cockpit"
>Convego® Token Cockpit</a>.)</p>
<p>This concept is very successfully used in different payment
scenarios. For example, when you import your credit card into
Google Pay and Apple Pay, they immediately tokenize it so that it
can only be used from within the respective app and device. If an
attacker were to clone the credit card number from Apple Pay, it
would be useless to them. Relatedly, issuers can also provide
offline-capable tokens for contactless payments. A credit card (or
a smartphone) would store a few of those tokens on the device,
using up exactly one token for each payment. If the card runs out
of tokens, it needs to request new ones from the issuer, which it
conveniently does automatically the next time it is inserted into a
card reader.</p>

<figcaption>Tokenized payment cards in your smartphone's payment
app</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Technically, tokenization provides many security benefits by –
which is perhaps counterintuitive – greatly restricting the
usability of PANs. This also includes offline payments: As opposed
to the old knuckle-buster times, merchants can be sure that the
offline tokens received are unique and there is in fact a high
chance that they can be redeemed for actual cash. Furthermore,
tokenization may improve privacy, since merchants do not get their
hands on your actual PAN. This explains why it is <a href=
"https://www.opentext.com/what-is/tokenization">also used in non-payment scenarios</a>, for example with
phone numbers, passport numbers, or social security numbers.</p>
<h2>Digital currency tokens</h2>
<p>We are getting increasingly into the territory of digital
currency here. But there is another issue that we need to discuss.
In the world of credit (or debit) cards, payments are always based
on identities. You use a payment card as a credential to
authenticate towards your bank, which then confirms the
transaction. But crucially, multiple intermediaries are involved,
which means that settlement is delayed, which means that funds are
not immediately transferred. This is also the case in many
high-volume and/or high-amount transactions. For example, stock
transfers often take <a href=
"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tplus1.asp">two business days to settle</a>, down from five business
days some decades ago. Reasons for this are manifold and I will not
be getting into them.</p>
<p>One promising approach to make settlement faster is – you may
have guessed it – tokenization. Unfortunately, even in this narrow
context, the term is still confusingly overloaded. For example,
McKinsey, a consultancy, <a href=
"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-tokenization"
>defines tokenization</a> as “the process of issuing
a digital representation of an asset on a (typically private)
blockchain”. Many also lump together several types of assets, such
as <em>non-fungible tokens (NFT)</em>, <em>stablecoins</em>,
securities, and others, and even worse, also include different
technologies, such as smart contracts, into this big ball of mud.
But blockchains or smart contracts are not even a prerequisite of
tokenization.</p>
<p>Let me try to untangle this mess.</p>
<h2>Representing money</h2>
<p>… and for that, we need to start with the fundamental term
<em>asset</em>. Investopedia <a href=
"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp">defines an asset</a> as “a resource with economic value
that an individual, corporation, or country owns”. Typical assets
can be physical cash (banknotes), commodities (gold), stock (a
share of a company), bonds (T-bills), or deposits (bank account
balance). Even more broadly, some ISO standards <a href=
"https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso:22739:ed-2:v1:en">define an asset</a> as “anything that has value to a
stakeholder”.</p>
<p>Different assets are typically exchanged in different systems.
For example, if you have a bank account, you can instantly transfer
money to a friend’s account at the same bank, but if the money goes
to a different bank, it must flow through one or more additional
systems. This typically involves the central bank to settle
balances across banks. Now it becomes easy to see why stock
transfers take so long, because they are typically exchanged for
cash, which means multiple different asset types must flow in a
synchronized fashion through multiple different systems.</p>
<p>The key idea is now to represent those assets on a platform
where they can be moved much faster and possibly with less
friction. An early example of this is Ethereum, a public blockchain
that provides both a built-in cryptocurrency (named
<em>Ether</em>), and a platform to implement <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dlt-necessary-build-cbdc-part-2-dr-lars-hupel/"
>smart contracts</a>. As <a href=
"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/tokens-and-accounts-in-the-context-of-digital-currencies-122320.html"
>Lee <em>et al.</em></a> have already pointed out in
2020, that “current concepts of tokens and tokenization likely
originate from their usage in the context of Ethereum”. The
Ethereum blockchain – as opposed to Bitcoin – is flexible enough to
represent multiple asset types on the same ledger. This has led to
a spur of various players to issue their own assets based on
Ethereum. In this context, such assets are referred to as
<em>tokens</em>. In fact, there are various standards to ensure
uniform use of different assets, with the most popular being
<em>ERC-20</em>. These standards define generic operations, such as
issuance and transfer. To quote Lee <em>at al.</em>, they
effectively define “a sub-ledger of Ethereum, specific to that
particular smart contract”. As of December 2023, <a href=
"https://www.coinlore.com/token-types/erc20">CoinLore</a> lists 4448 such tokens (see also the
screenshot).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Screenshot from CoinLore, taken December

</figure>
<p>Many stablecoins employ ERC-20 compliant smart contracts, and
many newer cryptocurrency blockchains provide similar
functionality, leading to a large ecosystem of crypto tokens.</p>
<p>For reasons that are not relevant for this article, many central
banks, when designing and issuing their CBDC, will not be choosing
(public nor private) blockchains, but instead building their own
platforms. This notwithstanding, the commonality is that some form
of asset is represented on some type of ledger – possibly
centralized –, with access to that ledger granted using some
cryptographic means. In short: wallets can transact digital assets
stored on a ledger using secret keys. Intermediaries may be
involved in custody of assets, but settlement happens directly
between wallets. The asset is represented as data that can move
between participants.</p>
<p>This now leads us to a key question: If tokens refer to assets
managed using an ERC-20 contract on blockchain, what does
“token-based” vs. “account-based” CBDC mean?</p>
<h2>Native tokens</h2>
<p>Congratulations, you have made it that far into the article
where we finally open this can of worms. A lot has been written
about token- vs. account-based CBDCs. You can probably find a dozen
articles on it in less than a minute of searching the web.</p>
<p>In the terminology of this article, accounts are credentials,
and tokens are vouchers. It is really as simple as that. Some
people have argued that the distinction is meaningless because
wallets will abstract away such implementation details and users do
not have to care. I am not denying that: your average consumer
paying at a merchant or a friend, has no idea how that works
currently, nor how it will work with CBDC. They care that they move
some money from here to there.</p>
<p>But this glosses over the fact that this seemingly tiny
implementation detail influences the technical design of the
overall system considerably.</p>
<p>In my experience during workshops, I have realized that the
notion of accounts comes naturally to people, whereas they have a
hard time conceptualizing tokens. I will offer a possible
explanation now.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="{% link assets/img/topics/digital-currency/token/account.png %}" alt="">
<figcaption>Transferring money from account to account</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is an actual slide I use during workshops. An account-based
system means that I have a table mapping names to balances. A
transaction simply deducts from one balance and adds the same
amount to another balance, here € 9. The slide shows actual names
like <em>Alice</em> and <em>Bob</em>, but in reality, it could just
be numbers. Now recall that what Alice and Bob really have is a
cryptographic secret (a credential), stored in their wallets, which
allows them to control their entire balance. This secret is
long-lived, i.e., it stays constant as long as Alice and Bob use
their wallets. But research in cryptography strongly recommends not
to use long-lived secrets, but instead replace them often. What is
more, as we have argued in <a href=
"{% link _research/pqc-cbdc.html %}">our recent
paper</a>, such secrets are more prone to attacks enabled by
post-quantum computing. Ethereum – as the pioneer of an
account-based cryptocurrency – is particularly affected by
this.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to a token-based approach. It was pioneered
by Bitcoin, where it is referred to as <em>unspent transaction
outputs</em>, or <em>UTxO</em> for shot. This phrase will become
clear in a second.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="{% link assets/img/topics/digital-currency/token/tokens.gif %}" alt="">
<figcaption>Transferring token money from wallet to wallet
(animation)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As I mentioned, this model is harder to conceptualize, so I am
using an animation. Alice and Bob once again have wallets. But
instead of a flat balance, the wallets store several cryptographic
secrets (vouchers or tokens), each standing for an individual
value. The total value commanded by a wallet can be easily computed
by summing up the individual token values. In the slide I have
labelled each token with a random string and value to make clear
that they are all distinct.</p>
<p>To transfer € 9, Alice’s wallet must first select a subset of
her tokens. Here, the wallet uses € 8 and € 5, which is € 4 more
than expected. To obtain the exact change, she uses those tokens to
create two new tokens worth € 9 and € 4. In this transaction, the
two input tokens are consumed and lose their validity, whereas the
two output tokens are freshly created and brought into existence.
This is of course only admissible if Alice does not try to generate
more money than she had before. In Bitcoin, this process is called
<em>spending</em>. Remember “unspent transaction output”? This is
why: Bob’s wallet has now received a token that is the result of a
transaction and which he in turn has not spent yet.</p>
<h2>Live fast, die young</h2>
<p>In other words, tokens are not supposed to last. They are
typically replaced on each payment. With respect to security, this
even seems counter-intuitive. But in computer science, it is a
well-understood concept. In Filia, we even went to great lengths to
<a href=
"{% link topics/digital-currency/formal-methods.html %}"
>mathematically prove</a> that our implementation of
tokens is correct. Granted, in Filia, a wallet itself also has an
identity, albeit for different purposes (a story for another time,
maybe).</p>
<p>The conceptual advantage of tokens is that they are
pseudo-anonymous by definition. The ledger system that ensures the
tokens’ authenticity – the equivalent of the accounting system from
above – does not need to know which wallets hold which tokens, or
how much of them they command at any given point. If you want
privacy by design, you need to use tokens.</p>
<p>Before I finish off this article, let me make another point
abundantly clear. No matter the precise choice of accounts vs.
tokens, or even if a hybrid model is selected: this choice bears
absolutely no influence on whether the ledger is a blockchain or a
traditional database. All quadrants (accounts vs. balances, DLT vs.
database) have abundant examples. (If you want to learn more about
that aspect, check out <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dlt-necessary-build-cbdc-part-1-dr-lars-hupel/"
>my series on DLT in the context of CBDC</a>.)</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We have seen several different interpretations of the
<em>tokens</em> and <em>tokenization</em>. The space is full of
misunderstandings. For example, even though they fundamentally run
on accounts, assets implemented using the ERC-20 standard are often
confusingly referred to as <em>tokens</em>. I am sure if I were to
look around various ISO standards, I would find even more
contradictory definitions. (We’re <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lars-hupel_last-week-a-group-of-experts-gathered-in-activity-7139184196354232320-Mkyh/"
>working on that</a>, though!)</p>
<p>In the context of CBDC, the most obvious use of tokens is in the
schism between accounts and tokens. I have explained that accounts
are long-lived, whereas tokens are short-lived. There are many more
(technical) nuances to this debate. But to make sure everyone talks
about the same thing, good terminology is important.</p>
<p>This is why I suggest using <em>native tokens</em> to
distinguish value-bearing CBDC tokens from other uses of
tokenization.</p>
<p>This should also illustrate my last, but not least point:
Traditional (often pull-based) payment schemes need tokenization to
make them more secure. In CBDC, we have the chance to design the
system from scratch, based on best practices. A whole range of
other requirements would immediately be addressed, among them
privacy and security.</p>
<p>Native tokens are the way to go: they extend the attributes of
cash to the digital world.</p>
