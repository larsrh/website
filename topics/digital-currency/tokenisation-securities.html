 As we increasingly move towards digitisation and decentralisation, tokenisation has gained much traction in the financial world. But how is tokenisation related to securities and what else is missing to make markets more efficient?

<p>Securities, according to one definition, are tradable financial
assets, and can come in many different forms, whether as equities,
such as stocks, or debt, such as bonds. The concepts behind
securities <a href=
"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp"
>date back as early as antiquity</a>, when debt instruments
were also known to be traded. Since then, modern-day markets have
contributed to a staggering growth in trading volume – <a href=
"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/04/ranked-the-largest-bond-markets-in-the-world/"
>the World Economic Forum reported</a> that the
global bond market has reached $133tn in 2022.</p>
<p>Yet, buying and selling securities is still fraught with
inefficiencies. To this day, most bonds are not traded in exchanges
and even those securities traded on exchanges suffer from
frictions, like delayed settlement. In the US stock market,
settlement could historically take up to five business days, which
has now been <a href=

>reduced to just one.</a></p>
<p>What does that have to do with tokenisation? Issuing securities
helps both the public and private sector to raise funds for
investments. Trading securities also provides additional liquidity
and helps to manage risks. Tokenisation is simply the logical next
step – by improving the efficiency of both issuance and trade, such
as capital and money markets, through further digitisation.</p>
<p>For a recent example, take the German Electronic Securities Act
(“Gesetz über elektronische Wertpapiere”). Before its passage in
2021, securities had to be physically embodied as deeds. In short,
the act allows for fully digital issuance of (certain classes of)
bonds and shares. In particular, there is a focus on bearer
instruments, specifically assets that are under the full custody of
the current owner and that can be freely traded in a peer-to-peer
fashion.</p>
<p>The act does not prescribe a particular technology – both
‘central’ and ‘crypto’ registers are allowed. This serves to
illustrate that the law aims to support a broad scope of
digitalisation, instead of needlessly restricting it to blockchain.
As of May 2024, <a href=
"https://www.bafin.de/DE/PublikationenDaten/Datenbanken/Kryptowertpapiere/kryptowerte_node.html"
>over 90 issuers</a> have opted to issue electronic
securities. Prominently, Siemens, in 2023, <a href=
"https://www.hal-privatbank.com/news/2023/hauck-aufhaeuser-lampe-fungiert-als-registerfuehrer-fuer-erstes-kryptowertpapier-der-siemens-ag-ueber-60-millionen-euro"
>successfully issued</a> a €60m bond.</p>
<p>No matter the underlying platform choice, merely digitising the
securities does not solve paying for them. In traditional
securities trading, there is a dual settlement risk: the seller may
not provide the securities in time, whereas the buyer may not pay
in time. The goal is to allow for both legs to settle in real-time
and simultaneously – a property often referred to ‘delivery versus
payment’. Tight integration between central securities depositories
and real-time gross settlement systems, such as the <a href=
"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/t2s/html/index.en.html"
>TARGET2-Securities facility</a> in the European
Union, have already begun to address this challenge.</p>
<p>Tokenisation of money could advance the economy even further, by
giving an instant settlement instrument for the cash leg. For
starters, a wholesale central bank digital currency, designed as a
bearer token and as a central bank settlement asset, could be used
by financial institutions to move funds instantly and irrevocably.
Currently, some market participants, such as dealers, could not
have direct access to central bank reserves: they had to rely on
bank deposits carrying counterparty risk.</p>
<p>But a bearer CBDC – being a risk-free asset – could enable
dealers to hold and pay in central bank money directly. Regulated
stablecoins (as through the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation in
the Euro area) could also function as the underlying payment
rail.</p>
<p>In the markets of the future, we can issue and trade financial
assets with ease. Key ingredients are tokenisation of securities
and a CBDC or other private forms of tokenised monies for payments.
Both can be provided on various platforms and need not be bound to
one particular technology. More importantly, they must be designed
as bearer instruments, which would eventually also help retail
investors to participate using a variety of wallets.</p>
