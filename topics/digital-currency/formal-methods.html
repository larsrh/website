abstract: |
  In a recent article, I explained that the common practice of software testing may not provide sufficient confidence in the correctness of software in critical domains. As an improvement over this state of affairs, I outline various techniques referred to as ‚Äúformal methods‚Äù. But in the context of CBDC, why is this important, and how can those methods be employed to increase trust in the system?

<h2>What are formal methods?</h2>

<p>As I wrote in the <a href="{% link _articles/testing-doesnt-cut-it.md %}">earlier
article</a>, the term <em>formal methods</em> denotes a diverse
range of tools and approaches with which, in simple terms, the
implementation of a software can be examined for errors without
relying on concrete or predefined inputs and examples. To give you
a concrete, real-life example: the algorithm running in your GPS
navigation software should always guarantee that it finds a way
from your current location to your destination. Since no engineer
could test all combinations of inputs to the system, the algorithm
could be analyzed by a tool that ensures on abstract level that
each potential valid input leads to valid output, without actually
testing each potential valid input.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, real-world applications are complex, layered
systems: They run on top of an operating system that runs on top of
hardware (itself using firmware), relying on lots of third-party
frameworks and libraries. Formal methods can be utilized to examine
some parts of this stack, but will fall short in case of ‚Äúblack
swan‚Äù events, such as the CPU malfunctioning.</p>
<p>Having said that, the amount of assurance formal methods can
provide is considerably better than simple software testing. It is
therefore crucial to identify the most critical pieces in a
software stack and then apply such tools to detect and fix
problems. In the case of CBDC, this would be, for example, the core
ledger and the wallets.</p>
<h2>How are formal methods used?</h2>
<p>For our CBDC solution G+D Filia, we started using a particular
tool called <a href=
"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/"><em>Isabelle</em></a> very early
on. During my doctoral studies at Technical University M√ºnchen, I
worked with this tool intensively, particularly on compilers for
programming languages. Similarly, my colleague <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterzel/">Peter Zeller</a>, hailing
from Technical University Kaiserslautern, has worked with Isabelle
on the verification of distributed applications.</p>

</figure>
<p>Therefore, our main focus of attention was to build a
high-quality model of Filia‚Äôs ledger, which in our architecture is
called the ‚ÄúCore System‚Äù. The purpose of this system is to verify
tokens for authenticity and prevent double spending. As you can see
from the diagram, the Core System is used by all other components,
making it critical for availability and security.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Isabelle appears to be a programming
language together with a development environment comprising an
editor and a standard library. But besides from writing code in
Isabelle, we can also prove mathematical properties.</p>
<p>Filia is a token-based CBDC, which means that we started out
defining what a <em>token</em> is, and how tokens evolve in the
cash cycle. In Filia, there are only a few different modifications
allowed on a token, which we call <em>commands</em>. There are two
types of commands: <em>privileged</em> (can only be executed by the
central bank) and <em>unprivileged</em> (can be executed by whoever
is in possession of the token). Notably, unprivileged commands must
not change the monetary supply. This is true for example when
splitting a token of a given denomination into two tokens with
smaller denominations. The Core System must validate that the sum
of the resulting tokens‚Äô denominations exactly matches the original
token‚Äôs denomination.</p>
<p>Now, while this may sound trivial, it actually requires
substantial effort to validate such properties. For mathematicians,
the set of tokens ‚Äì including all historic tokens that have been
used at some point ‚Äì can be modelled as a <em>directed acyclic
graph</em>. From this, we can derive the conditions that have to be
checked when we validate a token. Additionally, we can study
subsets, which is relevant for offline payments, where tokens
cannot be immediately reported to the Core System. Ultimately, this
allows us to process multiple tokens together during offline
reconciliation, increasing performance. I have explained more
details on offline payments <a href=
"{% link topics/digital-currency/offline-payments-filia.html %}">
in another article</a>.</p>

  <figcaption>An example for token evolution: The central bank
  creates a token with a denomination of 10, followed by a user
  splitting it into two tokens, worth 2 and 8.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We went even further than that and also examined how wallets
orchestrate these modification commands for end-to-end
transactions. This is where the tool <a href=
"https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html"><em>TLA+</em></a>
comes into play. It excels at the verification of distributed
systems and protocols. With it, we can also study how different
components with independent processes work together to execute a
payment. It allows us to reason about the tokens that are contained
within a wallet, and how those wallets extract and insert tokens
worth a particular denomination. TLA+ automatically explores the
state space of the system to detect if invalid states can occur,
such as transactions that cannot be completed due to a network
interruption. To fix such issues, we have implemented logic to
automatically retry online payments, therefore increasing
resilience. But at the same time, we must prevent a retry to be
accidentally interpreted as a duplicate payment, deducting the
amount from the payer‚Äôs wallet twice! This is why we use formal
methods: to make sure complex flows do not have unintended
consequences.</p>
<h2>What have we learned?</h2>
<p>As you can imagine, a full CBDC solution requires many such
components that are deployed in many different contexts: the Core
System at the central bank, hosted wallets at intermediaries, and
hardware wallets in user custody, to name a few (see also the
diagram above).</p>
<p>Both Isabelle and TLA+ were instrumental in our system design.
While we continue using software testing, formal methods helped to
uncover complex corner cases and feature interactions that we could
address before they caused issues. Concretely, our garbage
collection feature, whereby historic tokens can be pruned from the
ledger, was first developed in Isabelle, and only later in the
production system built with Go. Due to the formal model, we
learned that we need to treat privileged and unprivileged commands
differently.</p>
<p>The concept of using formal methods for safety-critical systems
is definitely nothing new, but at G+D Filia, we are applying it to
concrete problems in the space of digital payment systems. To the
best of my knowledge, this makes us an industry leader.</p>
<p>We are actively engaged in further research on these topics. To
mention just one example: we have recently built an extension to
Isabelle that enables us to integrate with the Go programming
language. Also, we participate in the bilateral Austrian‚ÄìGerman
<a href=
"https://www.sifo.de/sifo/de/projekte/querschnittsthemen-und-aktivitaeten/bedrohungen-aus-dem-digitalen-raum/bedrohungen-aus-dem-digitalen-raum.html">
research cooperation ‚ÄúCONTAIN‚Äù</a> (link in German), where we focus
on the security of offline payments, including the use of formal
methods. This is part of a broader initiative towards safeguarding
international supply chains, where digital payments play a leading
role.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>CBDC is a critical piece of infrastructure that needs to adhere
to high degrees of security, resilience, and correctness. Among the
most important properties of a CBDC are: Money should never get
lost during a transaction; the central bank should be the only
instance to be able to create money; users cannot spend a token
twice. How can we ensure this?</p>
<p>üßÆ Using mathematical methods, we can formally model a CBDC
system. This model then describes the basic architecture, such as
the underlying account- or token-based approach, and the protocols
that are used to transact.</p>
<p>ü§î In this model, we can reason about the guarantees the system
provides. There are different tools available that vary in the
depth of the analysis they perform and their degree of automation.
For example, some tools work directly on implementation code,
whereas others operate on abstract mathematical formulas. There is
no one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>üåâ While this works quite well and is also used in other
industries, there are still some gaps: 100% confidence is not
attainable, since for some parts of the stack comprising hardware,
operating system, libraries, programming languages, ‚Ä¶ a formal
model is unavailable or would be prohibitively expensive to
create.</p>
<p>‚è´ Therefore, we can think of formal methods as one tool in the
toolbox to increase trust in the system. Many design flaws can be
caught before they are implemented, preventing bugs even before
they are introduced. It is important to prioritize the effort on
the most critical parts of the infrastructure.</p>
<p>üëõ In G+D Filia, we are also using such tools to ensure the
correctness of several technical components and protocols, proving
properties such as: money transfers will never end up in an invalid
state, and the amount of money in circulation stays constant
(except for minting and melting). We have also successfully
utilized formal methods to design new features.</p>
