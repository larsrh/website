<p>Lewis McLellan of <a href="https://www.omfif.org/">OMFIF</a> has
interviewed me about offline digital payments. The following is a
transcript, lightly edited for readability. Listen to the <a href=
"https://www.omfif.org/podcast/meeting-the-need-for-offline-digital-payments/">
original recording here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>So let’s start off with a little bit of context and
offline payments as a concept. Can you break that down a little
bit? I think it’s easy to assume that we know what that means. We
understand what the words mean individually, but I think it’s not
necessarily quite as simple as payments without Internet access.
Can you break down a little bit the types of payments that that
we’re talking about when we say offline payments?</strong></p>
<p>Fundamentally, it’s about the ability to pay. We want to be able
to pay in any scenario, be that with CBDC or with some other
payment instruments. The analogy that we like to make is with
cash—obviously—because G+D is also very strong in the cash
business. Cash is wonderful for proximity payments between two
people, you and me, somewhere out in the desert, we can make a
payment.</p>
<p>The other end of the spectrum would be card payments, which
works both for proximity situations—for example I go to a shop and
I buy something—and also for e-commerce.</p>
<p>So basically we got two ends of the spectrum covered here, but
currently there is no means of payment that combines the
convenience of both, right? The convenience of cash that it works
offline in any scenario, and the convenience of cards where we
don’t have to carry the cash around. And yeah, this is the gap that
we’re talking about here when we talk about digital offline
payments.</p>
<p>And the Bank for International Settlements has created this
terminology in their <a href=
"https://www.bis.org/publ/othp64.htm">Polaris project</a> where
they distinguish three degrees of offline: They talk about “staged
offline,” “intermittently offline,” and “fully offline.” And I
think I have a few moments to break that down.</p>
<p>“Fully offline” means there’s no online connectivity whatsoever.
No mobile reception, no nothing. And you do that forever. So cash
would be a fully offline means of payment because you never go
online with cash.</p>
<p>And then you have “intermittently offline,” which describes a
payment instrument where you can make some offline transactions,
even consecutive offline transactions. So I could pay my friend and
then my friend could pay someone else or offline. But eventually
you’re going to have to go online to sort of reconcile or like send
those payments to a back end system. The payment is already settled
offline, but you still want to kind of do some sort of
reconciliation afterwards.</p>
<p>And then there’s “staged offline,” where the payment is not
really settled. So you can make a payment offline. But for example,
the merchant who receives the payment cannot immediately use that
money to pay someone else. So that would be in traditional card
rails, where you can actually make these offline transactions, but
they only settle when the merchant actually uploads this
transaction to some back end system.</p>
<p>So <a href=
"{% link topics/digital-currency/offline-payments-filia.html %}">
for CBDC we’re kind of aiming for “intermittently offline,”</a> so
kind of for the middle ground in in here.</p>
<p>But—as you mentioned—there’s more and more interest also about
<a href=
"{% link _research/cbdc-interoperability.html %}">equipping
other payment rails with this intermittently offline functionality
including private money</a>. So for example if you have an instant
payment system, for example PIX or UPI, then there’s also some
interest in providing these offline capabilities, because for now
they don’t work offline at all.</p>
<p><strong>I just wanted to go a little bit more into this question
“intermittently offline” versus “fully offline”. Can you talk a
little bit about why it’s important to have this you know,
requirement for it to be reconciled offline versus just having it
entirely offline the whole time?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s a good question. And I think the easiest way to
explain this is security. Bank notes also don’t circulate offline
forever. Eventually they’ll come back to the central bank, and then
they’re validated, and they’re checked if they’re actually
authentic or counterfeit. So I think in particular central banks
have a strategic interest in making sure that there’s no
counterfeit money in circulation. That everything is secure and
that you have kind of like a safety net—a digital safety net—to
make sure that all the transactions use genuine money.</p>
<p>If you have a “fully offline” system, that is very hard to
achieve, because you will never be in a position to actually look
at the payment token and say, well this is good or not. So you
potentially have a high risk.</p>
<p>In the “intermittently offline” approach, where you demand some
kind of reconciliation, you do these sort of technical checks every
once in a while, maybe every two weeks or something like that. You
can say maybe you can do ten offline payments, something like that.
This does not mean that you need to disclose any kind of metadata.
So it’s not necessary for the reconciliation check to upload that I
have paid at the grocery store, that amount of money for this
purpose.</p>
<p>No, it’s just about checking the actual payment instrument, so
it’s checking that the €10 token that I have handed over to the
grocer is actually a valid €10 token. So this has to happen
occasionally, not all the time, in order to get a high degree of
security that central banks rightfully expect.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about why central banks, I
guess in particular, are treating this as a topic of strategic
importance. I mean, I guess it’s pretty obvious in countries with
remote areas where they don’t necessarily have Internet
connectivity or it’s not widespread or it’s not reliable, then it
makes sense there. But in countries where that’s not the case, if
it’s pretty universal and reliable, we’re still seeing some
interest in offline payments. Can you talk a little bit about why
that is?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, this this topic about Internet connectivity, this comes up
quite a lot. So it’s a fair question to ask, honestly.</p>
<p>Right now we have only one truly inclusive means of payment,
which is cash. And there’s nothing like cash available in the
digital space and like, if you look globally, there’s 1.4 billion
adults that remain unbanked. Even in the Eurozone, in Europe,
there’s significant adult population that could have bank accounts
and they don’t have bank accounts.</p>
<p>And that doesn’t even talk about children or some unemployed
people or tourists on there, which don’t have local bank
accounts.</p>
<p>So if you’re saying, well, you know everyone can get a bank
account, you’re still excluding some people. So it’s not just about
the connectivity, but it’s also about this kind of accessibility,
inclusivity. Case in point: If I want to get a credit card today or
a debit card, I need to go into a contract with some kind of third
party provider. There’s no such thing as a as a government run
payment scheme. There’s always this sort of a friction that is
introduced and there’s good reason for that. If I get a credit
card, the intermediary wants to know that I am creditworthy, right?
So they don’t want to give me a line of credit without knowing me.
They wouldn’t give a 10 year old child a €2000 credit line, of
course, so there’s good reasons for that.</p>
<p>There are also other factors here. For example, if I’m a
merchant and I want to accept payments, they’re charging fees for
that, and potentially some minimum fees. In some countries this
could be prohibitively expensive. These countries see proliferation
of alternative schemes like UPI in India.</p>
<p>But basically, long story short, if you’re only focusing on the
topic of Internet connectivity and say we have Internet
connectivity, it’s why people can pay digitally, you are excluding
still some members of society, and that’s not a good thing. So
offline payments—as we see it—are one piece of the puzzle towards
digital payments without having a bank account or without having an
account with some kind of private provider.</p>
<p>And this is why I also mentioned we can also think of offline
payments not just in the context of CBDC, not just in the context
of like a government-run system, but also as an <a href=
"https://pages.gi-de.com/filia-unplugged">add-on for other
systems</a> that are interested in “expanding the franchise,” if
you want. And ultimately if you have more people who can pay, this
is good for the economy, right?</p>
<p><strong>It’s also, you know, something the development banks
care a lot about, right? That’s always something they’re trying to
get the number of people able to use different payment systems up
and relying on physical cash alone for them often means they don’t
get credit access and things like that. So yeah, getting people
into other service, seems like a good idea.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but also—sorry, just one more point because you brought it
up. It’s also about providing choice for consumers, right? So
ideally, in a hypothetical society, as a consumer, I can decide
freely between using cash, using instant payments, using CBDC,
using credit cards, or any of the other payment rails. So
fundamentally I think it’s about providing that choice and having
this choice also makes for a more equitable payment ecosystem.</p>
<p>So I can, as a consumer, I say well I prefer cash because I like
carrying this around with me. I need to see how much money I have.
Someone else says, well, then I have to go to the ATM. So I prefer
to use card payments and someone else says, well, I travel a lot.
So a credit card is quite nice for that purpose.</p>
<p>So you have all of these choices and we’re not seeing them as
somehow competing. We’re seeing them as complementing each
other.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, and that choice not being made for you by the
circumstances.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, correct.</p>
<p><strong>Certainly you can see the advantages there. It is
something, however, that we hear a lot from, particularly the
central banks when we did our survey of central banks, the end of
last year that it’s something that they find difficult to deliver,
that they need a lot of help with that. There are some technical
challenges around. Walk us through what some of those challenges
are. Why people are struggling.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s definitely a big issue. Some people have said that
having a full blown retail CBDC with full offline capability is a
tall order. It’s already a kind of a big order when you don’t have
offline capability and you’re adding that additional issue on
top.</p>
<p>Well, I mean the existing payment rails, if you look at them,
they have only some degree of offline capability for example
traditional card payment rails. You cannot spend these
consecutively: I give the money to the merchant. The merchant will
have to wait maybe for two to three days until they can pay someone
else. So just “intermittently offline” payment capability is really
a novel concept, so it has no equivalence in the current payment
ecosystem. So yeah, I totally understand where this line of
thinking is coming from.</p>
<p>From our side, from G+D’s side, from the very beginning, we
considered how to handle secure consecutive offline payments and we
also spoke with a lot of central banks and this journey started
already many years ago, back when it wasn’t even called CBCD, back
when it was called regulated digital payments. I’m not sure if
anyone in the audience still remembers that term, but CBDC is
actually a fairly recent term.</p>
<p>So the requirements we gathered there was that this offline
payment needs to come with a very simple and intuitive user
interface because cash: everyone can use it, even children can use
it. So this is what we should be aiming for.</p>
<p>Second, it needs to be available through some kind of form
factors that are cheap, low cost, and universal. So some people
might want to run it on their existing smartphone, but if someone
does not have a smartphone, then it should also be available on
smart cards. Small cheap phone factors.</p>
<p>And the third point is—obviously, the topic of privacy which in
in particular in the advanced economies, is a big topic, right? So
you want to have something like privacy comparable to cash,
“cash-like.”</p>
<p>And what we came up with to <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/true-offline-payments-impossible-dr-lars-hupel-j9thf/">
solve all of these topics together</a> is a token-based system. So
you have individual tokens which you could think of like as bank
notes. They have some kind of value attached to them and then you
can pass those tokens around between wallets.</p>
<p>And the key point here is that those wallets need to have some
kind of hardware security. And we can enable this hardware security
in all of these form factors that I mentioned.</p>
<p>Now, the reason why we’re doing that is because I mentioned you
want to make sure that there’s no counterfeit money, no fake token
circulating in the system. So you need to have this trust
somehow.</p>
<p>For a bank note, you can just look at the bank note and you can,
you know, look at the security features and you can wave it around.
You can see the hologram and then you’re somehow satisfied that
it’s a good bank note. In the digital world, you can’t do that. So
that’s why we need this hardware security.</p>
<p>Now, you put those <a href=
"https://thepaypers.com/expert-opinion/secure-wallets-for-cbdc-how-do-they-work--1266622">
tokens on these hardware wallets</a> and then they can transact
freely with each other.</p>
<p>And we’ve kind of demonstrated that this works. So you know,
from a technical perspective, I think a lot of the boxes have
already been checked.</p>
<p>There’s still, of course, the question of a rollout in a
particular country. So I, totally understand that this is still a
matter of discussion because all the countries are different. So to
summarize, I think the technology is there.</p>
<p>What’s missing now is like the remaining gaps to be addressed.
What are the form factors in a given country? What are the privacy
expectations in a given country? What are users familiar with? How
do users currently do their transaction?—and then try to imitate
that somehow. So I think this has to do a lot of with user
research, with convenience and so on. All of these accessibility
topics.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I think that’s something that we hear a lot in the
in the general DMI [Digital Monetary Institute] areas: the
technological challenge is solved, but there’s a surprisingly big
gap between that happening and central banks having made all the
policy decisions and decided exactly what they want from it and
that does seem to take longer. And there’s a limited way of
generalizing from one central bank to another, right? Everyone’s
got their own their own preferences and in in light of that, can
you talk a little bit about the pilots that you guys have been
involved in and maybe some of the differences in in requirements
that people have had there?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. So I will start this answer with a with a short anecdote.
As part of my job, I travel around the world quite a bit and I work
with central banks very closely and I’ve been, for example, in
Ghana to work there on the offline pilot that we did with the Bank
of Ghana. But I was also in in Hong Kong where we did a pilot
project together with Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
<p>And in both countries I faced the same problem. When I had to
get from the airport to the hotel, the taxi drivers only wanted to
accept cash. And the reason why they wanted to take cash is not
because they wanted to commit tax fraud, but because they needed to
refuel their car after a few rides. And if you pay with card, then
they can’t refuel their car, they need to wait for a bit. And they
don’t have that kind of working capital—as the economists would
say—to just do that for two or three days. So in both countries or
regions like Ghana as an emerging economy and Hong Kong as
technologically advanced, you have the same problem. So some points
do generalize.</p>
<p>This consecutive offline payment seems to be a big topic in in
in many jurisdictions, right, so that that much for the
anecdote.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about the Ghana project. First, I guess when we
did the pilot there, we actually had a few surprises in terms of
payment patterns, right? So there were a lot very long chains of
offline payments that we that we saw.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a citizen somewhere doing your grocery
shopping, you go to a small street merchant. And then you buy some
rice, some other food items, and then that street merchant goes to
a bigger merchant like some kind of big food vendor and pays there
and then that food vendor goes to a farmer and then that farmer
goes to a wholesale supplier. So you have all of these long chains
of offline payments, we certainly did not anticipate that.</p>
<p>But it was a very important learning for us and in particular
also learning what kind of form factors people are using. So in
Ghana we included a lot of people in the pilot who have never done
a digital payment in their life before. So all they ever used was
cash. So for them, the smart card was a very important form
factor.</p>
<p>Now if you look for example in Hong Kong. Well, people have
smartphones in Hong Kong, right? So maybe the smart card is not
that an important form factor.</p>
<p>Still in Hong Kong, we did the survey and they said about 80% of
the consumers saw the value in the offline payment of this
hypothetical Hong Kong CBDC. So that was kind of an important
learning also from us seeing that even in these technologically
advanced regions you have that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Maybe also in the Bank of Thailand project. There they were also
more concerned with smartphones. We tried both smart cards and
smartphones there. And <a href=
"https://www.bot.or.th/en/financial-innovation/digital-finance/central-bank-digital-currency/_/Pilot-CBDC-2024.html">
they gave us some really good feedback</a>, because they were
talking about the amount of transactions that you can do while
you’re disconnected. So they were quite happy with that.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, they also found that handling NFC
payments can be somewhat tricky because you have to kind of hold
the card to a card reader and in some. In some countries, people
are used to that. In other countries people are not used to that.
In Thailand, a lot of people are used to QR code payments. So they
are very happy with how that works. So they’re used to that. And
NFC was, apparently, not so common.</p>
<p>Whereas in Hong Kong, people could pay with NFC, no problem,
because they’re used to that.</p>
<p>So I guess a long-winded way of saying all of these pilots had
very different characteristics. There were some, some
commonalities.</p>
<p>But again, these pilots, as we see, are very crucial to learn
about the behaviours of people, and ultimately you want to provide
a public utility. You want to be able to provide people with the
ability to pay. And in order to do that, you need to understand how
they’re paying now and what pain points they have. And then you try
to tailor your pilot projects to address these pain points.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I guess that’s a really interesting challenge
because you know you can do all the work you want on the security
and the settlement and so on. But ultimately this is a tool that
people have to use every day hopefully. And I guess one of the
challenges is if you’re going to get people to adopt, it is
integrating it with how people are already using money because,
presumably it is quite difficult to get people to behave in a way
they’re unfamiliar with.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s totally true. So you could say that there’s really
no one-size-fits-all rollout strategy. So this is why we at G+D, we
typically suggest a phased approach where you include the
stakeholders from the very beginning. So we have done a few
consulting projects also in in terms of digital payments and what
we always start with is like: get the banks on board, get the
merchants on board, get a few end users on board. You know you want
to talk to them and then you start with the small pilot and you
test your hypothesis and then you figure out the payment
patterns.</p>
<p>Maybe you do another survey. Maybe you do data analytics on the
data that you’ve collected. That’s what we’ve done with Bank of
Ghana to figure out the payment patterns, to run some analytics on
that.</p>
<p>And also, what you kind of mentioned is that the integration and
the interoperability is a big topic and this is also where the
countries differ the most, in my personal opinion.</p>
<p>Every country has an existing payment system. They have an
existing RTGS, they might have an existing instant payment system.
All of these things exist. They have ATMs. In African countries,
you have a lot of mobile money agents.</p>
<p>So all of these very heterogeneous ecosystems are already there,
and one thing that I find particularly charming about adding
offline capability to existing payment schemes is also that you
have new intermediaries, new types of intermediaries like telcos
that could provide these kinds of services.</p>
<p>So when we do these CBDC projects, we’re also trying to talk to
the “non-standard” players. I want to say—like, obviously they have
a big role to play, the telcos—but they’re typically not seen as
banks. But there’s no reason why they couldn’t also provide
financial services and some of them already do provide financial
services.</p>
<p>So we think this is a good way to increase reach. And the
merchants, of course. If you don’t have the merchants on board,
they don’t accept your payment method and then you can’t use it,
right? So the merchants are kind of one of the most important
aspects of actually using it on the ground. They need to upgrade
their POS terminals, for example, even if they have not been
designed with offline payments in mind, so this is also another
important piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>I guess this is my way of saying that if you want to transform
the payment ecosystem, you have to first understand the payment
ecosystem, right?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think, bringing, you know,
telcos and other new entrants in is typically good from a policy
perspective as well, right? It should be good for competition. It
generally leads to good outcomes when you have new providers
entering, lowering the barrier to entry and providing
services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We kind of touched on it a little bit, but perhaps we
should go into in a little bit more detail. Obviously offline
payments is fundamentally—we’ve talked about the sort of
non-technical aspects of making sure people can use it, but
fundamentally, that you do need technology. You do need hardware to
deliver this. Is that something that you can integrate with what’s
already out there, or does it need full overhaul? What does the
rollout for the technology side of it look like.</strong></p>
<p>I guess the answer is yes and no. So we’re always trying to
build on existing technology as much as possible.</p>
<p>At its most fundamental level, we believe that <a href=
"https://thepaypers.com/expert-opinion/why-accounts-do-not-solve-double-spending--1267213">
secure offline payments require secure elements</a>, right? So you
want to have industrial-strength secure hardware in order to store
the tokens, in order to ensure that only authentic wallets are
operating in the system and that no one can, you know, use a
“custom” wallet that, for example, disrespects certain limits set
by the issuer, and so on.</p>
<p>So you want to make sure that all of this is captured in
hardware. And this is not a new idea. We have not invented the idea
of using Secure Elements for payments. If you look at the
industry.</p>
<p>Now the card industry uses Secure Elements. The identity
industry uses Secure Elements. If you have for example a national
ID card, there’s very high chances that there’s a Secure Element in
there. Your phone has a Secure Element. The SIM card is a Secure
Element, and so these pieces of hardware are incredibly
widespread.</p>
<p>They’re incredibly common and people—they have three or five of
them on them at any given point in time, or, if they don’t, you
just give them a smart card, right? The smart card is relatively
inexpensive. It’s also nice because the smart cards can be issued
directly to the consumer, so you can directly say: you know this is
the code that’s running. These are the policies with it. If you
have to go on an existing device or if you want to go on existing
devices, which you should, then it’s a bit harder.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lars-hupel_embedded-secure-elements-activity-7228694290816724993-9unM">
put CBDC tokens on an iPhone</a>, you would have to talk to Apple.
If you want to put it on a Samsung phone, you would need to talk to
Samsung, and so on. But you can also put it on the eSIM. For
example, <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lars-hupel_cbdc-can-gain-further-adoption-with-esim-activity-7224730639990759424-2fBi">
eSIM is very easy because you can just download it as a
consumer</a>, so it’s really not big of a hassle.</p>
<p>And that is also not a novel idea. If you look at Japan, for
example, with the Suica card, or in Hong Kong with the Octopus
card, those are transit cards. But you can also use them for
payment. And they’re also available in smart cards as a mobile
wallet, in the Secure Element, as a SIM card, and all of these
things.</p>
<p>And if you’re looking now at the news, if you have been
following the news, Apple has also now provided access to the
Secure Element of the iPhone. Not to everyone, not everywhere. So
they’re still in early phase of this rollout. But as a developer,
let’s say you want to equip your payment scheme, your instant
payment scheme with offline capability. You could talk to Apple,
you could apply for that access.</p>
<p>I think this is a positive trend in the market because it
enables technology vendors to leverage this secure hardware that
was so far a lot more restricted.</p>
<p>In the eurozone, when we talk about the digital euro, there’s
also this <a href=
"{% link topics/digital-currency/common-sense.html %}">
draft legislation on the digital euro</a> that’s currently being
considered by the European Parliament. And that one also says that
the vendors should give access to the secure hardware in those
devices, be it the SIM card or another type of Secure Element.</p>
<p>So, I think from a specification point of view, we are already
very close because all of these Secure Elements have very strict
specifications. They all behave in similar ways. They have similar
interfaces, so we’re ready to deploy on those.</p>
<p>And now it’s up to the manufacturers and the regulators to kind
of step up and say, OK, we’re happy with this use case and you’re
granting access in the most diverse way that you could think of,
right? So that you have all of these different form factors and if
someone doesn’t have a smartphone, then they can still have a smart
card. You can still equip them with that.</p>
<p><strong>It’s very interesting here that a lot of the technology
is already out there. But yes, I did see that about Apple and I
guess that was fortunate because it would have been a big problem
for the digital euro legislation, if Apple wasn’t providing that,
you know, a provider of such scale. So I guess that’s probably not
a coincidence, but fortunate timing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So yeah, well, I we’re getting close to the end here,
but I guess let’s look a little bit into the future. How are
people, you know,—people’s attitudes have changed a lot to what
they expect from payments over the past five years or so or maybe a
little bit longer, but I don’t think we’re at a final point by any
means there. So what are you expecting in terms of changes to
people’s attitudes towards payments and what they expect they’re
going forward?</strong></p>
<p>I think, honestly, we see much broader changes right now, not
just focused on end users and consumers and so on. So we’re seeing
kind of this, <a href=
"{% link topics/digital-currency/tokenisation-securities.html %}">
this idea of tokenization</a>, which would sort of permeates the
entire payment industry, no matter what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Anything that affects the end user or if it affects, for example
wholesale payments, right, because wholesale payments are still
there. I have not talked about wholesale at all in this podcast so
far, but, no matter where you look in the industry, everyone’s
talking about tokenization. So it’s kind of driven by many
different market participants and also from many different
perspectives, right?</p>
<p>So, a stock broker is interested in very different things than a
merchant, but still they both suffer from some kind of restrictions
in in existing payment systems, right? So for example, the
stockbroker also suffers from the fact that very often they can’t
instantly settle their payments. So you sell a lot of—you sell a
large bond, and then you have to wait two days for the payment to
come in.</p>
<p>Obviously that’s a problem on a very different scale than the
taxi driver in Hong Kong, but it’s still kind of similar—similar
reasons for these.</p>
<p>So, I think this token-based digital money, if you call it
retail CBDC, if you call it deposit tokens, if you call it stable
coins—whatever—really has the potential to transform the entire
financial ecosystem, and retail CBDC is just one piece to this
puzzle.</p>
<p>And ultimately, they might have different technologies, so I
don’t expect the digital euro to work in the same way as the
digital pound or some kind of new stable coin in the euro area or
whatever or wholesale, they would all probably have different,
technological design.</p>
<p>But ultimately, they <a href=

could work together</a> to make the system more efficient and more
transparent. Even if you look, if you zoom in again on the on the
end results, then offline payments will contribute also to the
resilience in case of outages or some kind of natural disasters. So
this is also an important aspect that’s talked about a lot. How to
increase the resilience of the system.</p>
<p>If you look at all of these different pieces of the puzzle that
I’ve just mentioned, it’s clear that it needs to coexist and they
need to cooperate, and they need to integrate with each other.</p>
<p>And once again a reference to the Bank of International
Settlements: they call the system “Finternet” as the analogy to the
Internet. So they think of the Finternet as kind of value that you
can route to multiple entities. And you know, that value can—no
matter if the value is an offline token or a stock or whatever—you
can kind of route it through the system.</p>
<p>So I think this is like a broader context that we’re talking
about here. And I think, simply put, our mission from G+D is to
build trust in this new system both from the offline perspective,
what was the main focus of this podcast, but also for the other
layers that will come together there.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, absolutely. Very exciting time in payments. We’ll
have to leave it there. As you said, there’s a lot more we could be
discussing in offline payments, and it is just a part of the
puzzle. Wholesale we haven’t touched on. But a great deal to be
discussed going forward. Thanks for your insights,
