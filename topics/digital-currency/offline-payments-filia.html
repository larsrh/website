  The <em>BIS Innovation Hub</em>, as part of <em>Project Polaris</em>, has recently published a <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp64.htm">comprehensive handbook for offline payments with CBDC</a>. In this document, they investigate issues like ‚Äúsecurity, privacy, likely risks, the types of solution, their maturity and applicability, and operational factors‚Äù. In this post, I will attempt to explain how our CBDC solution G+D Filia fits within their framework, and how it fares in some of the categories they analysed. This is focused on offline payments, but if you want to learn more about our solution in general, check out <a href="https://www.gi-de.com/en/payment/central-bank-digital-currencies/cbdc-implementation">Filia's homepage</a>.

<h2>Modes of offline payment</h2>
<p>G+D Filia can be characterized as <em>‚Äúintermittently
offline‚Äù</em>: value transfer is immediate and settled instantly,
without the need for online connectivity. This also means that
payments are final and cannot be reversed later. We also support
<em>consecutive offline payments</em>, where funds received offline
can be subsequently spent offline. As opposed to a fully offline
solution, hardware wallets must reconcile with the core system
periodically. However, the data being transmitted does not contain
personally identifying information, just technical data to
authenticate tokens. The core system does not learn about the
identities of the payment parties.</p>
<h2>Ledger</h2>
<p>What the Polaris paper calls ‚Äúledger‚Äù, we call ‚Äúcore system‚Äù.
Its purpose is to keep a <em>register of money</em> that is
circulating in various kinds of wallets, such as online wallets
hosted at banks and hardware wallets in user custody. Crucially, we
have designed our solution such that the core system does not
retain any personally identifying information of token holders,
only the technical information to validate the tokens‚Äô
authenticity. Wallets can communicate with the core system to
validate and update tokens (for example, splitting a token into
smaller denominations). The core system does not distinguish
between an ‚Äúonline‚Äù and ‚Äúoffline‚Äù ledger, because the token format
is identical. In an offline situation, wallets would keep a record
of token operations and reconcile them with the core system later.
This does not mean that the core system must approve offline
transactions before they are considered to be settled. Rather, the
reconciliation process makes token updates known to the core system
eventually. Note that the core system is agnostic about the
underlying storage technology and supports several types of
databases or distributed ledgers.</p>
<h2>Wallets & values</h2>
<p>Wallets (or ‚Äúpurses‚Äù) can come in <em>different form
factors</em> in Filia. We distinguish wallets according to their
location: hosted at a bank or hardware devices in user custody. The
Polaris paper focuses on the latter because they can be used
offline. In Filia, hardware wallets store CBDC value directly on a
<em>Secure Element</em> (SE): a small, tamper-resistant security
chip that can be embedded in many different form factors (see
picture below). Modern smartphones have one or multiple SEs, as do
SIM cards and standalone payment cards. CBDC is represented as a
cryptographic private key, with an attached denomination, currency,
and some other information. SEs keep the private keys safe and
secret and ensure that value transfer can only happen over an
<em>end-to-end encrypted channel,</em> which can be established
over NFC, BLE, Wi-Fi, or other (insecure) communication
protocols.</p>

<h2>Risk & security parameters</h2>
<p>Any CBDC solution will be a prime target for attacks, especially
in offline scenarios. Therefore, we opted to use a solution whose
security relies on multiple pillars, with Secure Elements being one
of the most important. In our system, money can only be transferred
between <em>authenticated wallets</em> that are equipped with a SE,
or online wallets storing private keys safely in Hardware Security
Modules (HSMs). Payment devices, for example Android-based POS
terminals, act only as communication proxies, but are not able to
extract tokens being exchanged. In principle, our solution would
allow for lower-security wallets on TEEs or purely software-based
(e.g., through white-box cryptography), however this requires a
careful risk assessment, for example disabling consecutive offline
payments to avoid counterfeiting on less trusted devices. As a
further security measure, central banks can configure <em>limits
for offline payments and holdings.</em></p>
<h2>Key generation</h2>
<p>Hardware wallets manage ‚Äì broadly speaking ‚Äì two distinct kinds
of cryptographic keys: wallet keys and token keys.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Wallet keys</em> and the accompanying certificates based on
an industry standard (comparable to X.509) equip each wallet with a
unique identity. The certificate is signed via a PKI with the
central bank acting as the root certificate authority and is baked
into the wallet during manufacturing. The wallet keys are used for
establishing end-to-end encrypted payment channels and ensuring
authenticity in the ecosystem. Usually their lifetime is as long as
the lifetime of the hardware wallet (typically a few
years).</li>
<li><em>Tokens</em> are cryptographic key pairs representing value.
While those tokens have a digital fingerprint, they are not
associated with the wallet holder‚Äôs identity. They are also
frequently replaced, e.g., when tokens are split into smaller
denominations or merged into larger denominations. On these
occasions, one or more fresh key pairs are created autonomously by
wallets to substitute the original token, linking them together
using digital signatures. Wallets can generate fresh token keys
autonomously.</li>
</ol>
<p>During a payment transaction, first the wallet keys are used to
establish a secure channel, and then tokens are exchanged via that
channel. This ensures that the information required to validate
tokens and personal identities are neatly separated. Note that
counterparties cannot deduce a personal identity just by looking at
the wallet certificate, which only contains a pseudonymous serial
number. Only the issuing bank can establish the holder‚Äôs
identity.</p>
<h2>Online & offline balances</h2>
<p>Because we have a shared ledger of both online and offline
operations, tokens cannot be kept in multiple wallets at the same
time. In other words, a balance that may be available in a bank
account cannot simultaneously be available as cash. This is also
the case in Filia, where the wallet protocols ensure that tokens
move exclusively between wallets (the core algorithms behind those
protocols we have mathematically proved to be correct). Failing
that, it would be possible to spend more money than is owned, by a
clever combination of online and offline funds (the approach taken
by credit cards). Even though this might sound overly restrictive,
we can still use money stored in a CBDC hardware wallet for online
payments: it is possible to, e.g., pay for online shopping by
touching your smartcard to the back of your NFC-enabled phone, or
to even use the money that is stored inside the Secure Element of
your smartphone.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>üîÅ G+D Filia is intermittently offline. Payments are instantly
settled offline, with occasional online reconciliation. But most
importantly: funds received offline can be spent offline
(consecutive offline payments).</p>
<p>üí∞ Our token format is the same online and offline, therefore the
payment protocols are similar across different kinds of wallet
(e.g., online wallets hosted at banks and hardware wallets). No
conversion between online or offline ledger is needed.</p>
<p>üîê Tokens in hardware wallets are stored in tamper-resistant
Secure Elements. Each wallet is equipped with a certificate,
ensuring end-to-end encryption for every payment transaction. As an
additional safety net, wallets keep a record of offline operations
to detect counterfeiting.</p>
<p>üöß Central banks can configure limits for offline wallets, such
as maximum holding or mandatory reconciliation after some
consecutive payments. This serves both regulatory and technical
purposes for limiting money laundering and counterfeiting risks,
respectively.</p>
