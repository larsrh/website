<p>This sounds like a very simple question. But as usual, the
answer is not so simple …</p>
<p>As I have argued in <a href=
"{% link _research/cbdc-interoperability.html %}">my
paper</a>, CBDC needs to be interoperable with various classes of
other payment systems, such as <em>instant payment (IPS)</em>,
<em>real-time gross settlement (RTGS)</em>, but also stablecoins.
Even though stablecoins and CBDC have very different operational
characteristics, there is one commonality: they are typically
issued by a centralized entity.</p>
<p>The most popular stablecoins, USDT and USDC, are issued by
Tether and Circle, respectively. Those entities exert full control
over the supply and cash-in/cash-out transactions. Arguably, that
makes them centralized. (Note that I only consider
collateral-backed stablecoins here, and not algorithmic
stablecoins, <a href=
"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm">which work
differently</a>.)</p>
<p>But USDT and USDC are available on <a href=
"https://tether.to/en/transparency/" target="_blank">public
blockchains</a>, like Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and others. While
technical details differ across this platform, most stablecoins on
most platforms are provided in the form of a smart contract
according to the ERC-20 standard. That means that anyone with an
<a href=
"{% link topics/digital-currency/wallet.html %}">
Ethereum wallet</a> can obtain Tether and transact freely.
Transactions are validated through the underlying consensus
mechanisms of the distributed ledger. Arguably, that makes them
decentralized.</p>
<p>How can we reconcile these two positions? Instead of classifying
stablecoins in a binary of “centralized” or “decentralized”, we
need to take a more nuanced look.</p>
<p>Consider the underlying ledger first. As I have discussed in a
<a href="{% link topics/digital-currency/dlt/3.html %}">
previous post</a>, cryptocurrencies rely on a decentralized
network, using both a consensus algorithm that assumes no trust
between participants, and an incentivization structure that rewards
honest participation. Since stablecoins use the same
infrastructure, this aspect applies. Specifically, third parties
cannot prevent me from transacting with others.</p>
<p>But the stablecoin issuer can. Tether <a href=

routinely</a> <a href=
"https://news.bitcoin.com/tether-blacklists-over-30-usdt-wallets/">freezes</a>
addresses they believe are engaged in criminal activity. This can
easily be <a href=

observed on Etherscan</a>:</p>

trading Tether.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is not specific to Tether; other stablecoin operators also
<a href=
"https://protos.com/paypal-stablecoin-can-be-frozen-like-tether-and-circle/">
have the ability</a> to freeze and/or repossess holdings. Note that
this is distinct from stealing private keys from someone’s wallet:
it is simply a feature programmed in the smart contract. Because
smart contracts are generally open source, this can be inspected by
anyone. (In the case of PayPal’s PYUSD, a random programmer has
even <a href=
"https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract/pull/3">proposed a
code change</a> to remove the freezing feature.) With the advent of
regulation that sanction the general concept of stablecoins,
controls over how holdings can be used <a href=
"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/17/crypto-stablecoins-might-need-limits-warns-bank-of-england-.html">
are here to stay</a>.</p>
<p>You may now wonder: If most stablecoins have centralized
governance (like CBDC), why are they using a distributed ledger?
Stablecoins are often used as <a href=
"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-stable-in-stablecoins-20221216.html">
convenient trading vehicle</a> for cryptocurrencies, so it makes
sense to reside on the same platform. Ethereum is particularly
popular for this, where a lot of different assets are managed in
ERC-20 compatible contracts.</p>
<p>Other than that, stablecoins could also be running on different
platforms. There are already some projects that explore such
options, where both the issuance and the transaction aspects are
controlled by the same entity. One such example are <a href=
"https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2023/feb/deposit-token-a-foundation-for-stable-digital-money.html">
deposit tokens</a>. Options here are private blockchains or fully
centralized systems.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Most major stablecoins are issued by a centralized entity, which
control the supply and cash transactions. However, these
stablecoins are available on public blockchains, like Ethereum,
where transactions are validated through consensus mechanisms,
suggesting a decentralized aspect. This suggests that we should
take a more nuanced look at stablecoins. For example, while the
stablecoin issuer can freeze addresses suspected of criminal
activity, third parties cannot prevent transactions. Because the
use of stablecoins is expanding beyond a trading vehicle for
cryptocurrencies, some projects are exploring more centralized
approaches, removing the reliance on public blockchains.</p>
