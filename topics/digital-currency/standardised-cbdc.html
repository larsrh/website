<p>The European Central Bank is developing the digital euro based on a catalogue of requirements. These, in turn, come
  from the European Commission’s draft law, among other sources. But if you look beyond Europe, you can see clear
  differences to the CBDCs of other countries. Is there any prospect of harmonisation at a technical level?</p>
<p>Design options for a CBDC are diverse. Recently, the Bank of Canada discussed a series of so-called <a
    href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/10/staff-analytical-note-2022-14/">‘archetypes’</a>—i.e.
  common system design patterns—in a <a
    href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sdp2025-9.pdf">discussion paper</a>. They relate to how
  transactions are processed, and range from one extreme,
  namely directly between two devices, to fully centralised via the central bank.</p>

<p>Bank of Canada also identified other dimensions, such as the design of the wallets and the specific representation of
  monetary values. Not all combinations are suitable for all use cases: For example, offline payment is only possible in
  the direct model. This is why this model was used in the CBDC pilot projects in Ghana and Thailand.</p>
<p>Some central banks, on the other hand, prefer a centralised approach. These include the Bank of England and the
  European Central Bank. The digital euro will therefore also come in two versions (online and offline).</p>
<p>As it stands now, there are many CBDC designs, tailored to specific (and perhaps different) use cases and national
  characteristics. Is this a ‘proliferation’ of incompatible solutions or is standardisation foreseeable? The answer to
  this question is nuanced. Even today, managing the various payment methods for transactions is already challenging.

<p>We should note that the digital euro is a pan-European payment instrument that is prepared to support multiple
  currencies. This is also in line with ECB’s strategy, incorporating additional currencies into its systems (e.g.
  Danish krone) in the past.</p>
<p>This means that the digital euro is already one step ahead of the European schemes that can currently only be used
  nationally. Standardised interfaces will then ensure that a German wallet can be used in Spain without any problems.
  And of course, also in online shops.</p>
<p>At the international level, however, integration becomes more difficult. Several committees are currently working on
  the standardisation of CBDC solutions, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), specifically Technical Committee 68 on Financial
      Services;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the International Telecommunication Union (ITU);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <a
        href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/TR03179/BSI-TR-03179-Community-Draft.html">German
        Federal Office for Information Security</a> (BSI).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Not only are new standards required, but existing ones also need to be adapted. For example, the ubiquitous EMV
  standards for card payments at the checkout only support offline payments to a very limited extent. Other aspects of
  EMV such as PIN validation, on the other hand, can also be used for CBDC. The Bank of England analysed this in a <a
    href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2024/point-of-sale-proof-of-concept">proof of
    concept</a> last year. (See also <a href="{% link _research/cbdc-pos.html %}">my
    article</a> on the subject.)</p>
<p>The European Central Bank is also in favour of adapting existing standards as far as possible. Some of these have
  already been identified in the <a
    href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/timeline/profuse/shared/pdf/ecb.derdgp250409_RDG_progress_report_April_25.en.pdf">status
    report</a> from April of this year.</p>

</figure>
<p>As can be seen from the diagram, some new developments will be necessary for the European market. The situation is
  similar in other countries that want to introduce a CBDC.</p>
<p>At the international level, standardisation is therefore initially limited to the basics. The aforementioned ISO
  Committee 68 is currently developing a security model for hardware-based wallets, which only defines security
  objectives, but not how these are to be implemented. For example, it quickly became clear that different regions would
  adopt different crypto algorithms: some countries would not accept NIST recommendations and would instead rely on
  their own. This does not make international compatibility impossible, but it does make it more difficult.</p>
<p>Regardless of this, there is a consensus that international standards such as ISO 20022 will also play a role in the
  CBDC ecosystem. However, the actual implementation is still unclear, as tokenised payment methods—of which CBDC is
  one—break with some conventions of the traditional financial world.</p>
<p>Interoperability does not necessarily mean that all CBDCs must have an identical architecture. It can also be
  achieved through interfaces and agreements between the various banks and central banks, like what is currently the
  case with international credit cards.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>CBDC as a new payment instrument is still at the very beginning of technical harmonisation. Initially, the countries
  want to adapt it to their own needs; agility is particularly important here. Standardisation, on the other hand, is a
  lengthy process—already underway—that is based on consensus and requires practical experience.</p>
