<p>Much has been written about different technical implementation
options of central bank digital currencies. Often, the use of DLT
is proposed. It appears that the choice in favour or against DLT is
so fundamental, that the <a href="https://cbdctracker.org/">CBDC
Tracker</a> even has it as a dedicated category. Yet, I often
observe a lack of clarity about what DLTs are, what they can
provide, and how that relates to the desired characteristics of a
CBDC. In this series, I want to examine these topics in more
detail, starting out with an introduction to DLT. Stay tuned for
more!</p>

<h2>What is a DLT?</h2>
<p>As an academic reference, I will follow the definitions by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-03035-3">Xu et al.</a>
There, a <em>distributed ledger</em> is defined to be an
“append-only store of transactions which is distributed across many
machines”. Here, <em>append-only</em> means that the set of
transactions keeps growing, i.e., it is impossible to remove it at
a later point in time. Typically, this is ensured through
cryptographic means: If an attacker were to tamper with the ledger
on one machine, the other machines across which the ledger is
distributed, or a client interacting with the ledger, would reject
the entries that have been tampered with. A popular way to
implement such append-only storage is by using chains of hashes,
where older transactions and their hashes feed into hashes of newer
transactions. This concept is well-understood in computer science
and has many applications outside distributed ledgers. In other
words, a distributed ledger is a logbook of all transactions that
have occurred historically, and on which all nodes agree based on a
predefined consensus algorithm.</p>
<p>Adding on to that, Xu et al. define a blockchain to be a special
kind of distributed ledger, in which the ledger “is structured into
a linked list of blocks”. There, transactions are not treated in
isolation, but rather, they are grouped and processed together.
Typical examples for blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum. An
example of a distributed ledger that is not a blockchain is
<a href="https://www.corda.net/content/corda-technical-whitepaper.pdf">
Corda</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the term transaction is left unspecified in the above
definitions. This is intentional, since transactions can have many
different shapes. In the financial context, this is typically
understood to mean the moving of funds between parties, where those
movements may be simple (“A transfers $50 to B”) or conditional (“A
transfers $50 to B, unless C vetoes within one day”). Some systems
are more flexible and allow operators to assign custom meaning to
transactions.</p>
<p>Finally, let us turn our attention to the “T” in “DLT”, which
means <em>technology</em>. In other words, DLT abstracts away from
a concrete running system, and focuses on the technology platform
that can be used to implement distributed ledgers. This distinction
is important, but often murky: Ethereum can refer to both the
public Ethereum network, or the technology platform that powers it,
its various test networks, and many other instances. The collection
of algorithms, conventions, code, and other contributions to the
correct operation of a distributed ledger can be referred to as its
protocol.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this series, only the basic design criteria
of distributed ledgers are relevant. Consequently, I will ignore
most of the technical details, such as transaction and block
format, account or UTxO model, and cryptographic algorithms. The
reason is simple: CBDCs can be made to work on DLTs regardless of
those technical choices.</p>
<h2>What do distributed ledgers provide?</h2>
<p>While there are many varieties of distributed ledger platforms,
they share a few key characteristics, which I will discuss here:
<em>Immutability, Atomicity, Decentralization, Consensus,</em> and
<em>Incentivization</em>. Later in this series, I will analyse
which of these characteristics are useful for CBDC, as well as if
and how they can be achieved with non-distributed-ledger
technology.</p>

<figcaption>A pyramid of DLT characteristics. At the foundation,
there are technical properties of the ledger describing how
transactions are processed. Further up, it describes how
participants coordinate to form a coherent system (author’s own
illustration).</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Immutability</h3>
<p>Once a transaction has been accepted for inclusion in a
distributed ledger, it will not be removed. This is a direct
consequence of the ledger’s append-only nature. It also ensures
non-repudiation: parties to a transaction – once included in the
ledger – can neither successfully nor convincingly deny that the
transaction has happened. Another useful property is that the
current state of the world, e.g., account balances, can always be
re-computed by starting from any chosen state and re-applying all
transactions that have occurred since then.</p>
<h3>Atomicity</h3>
<p>Although – as discussed above – there is no uniform definition
of transactions, any distributed ledger treats its transactions as
<em>atomic</em>. In technical terms, <a href=
"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17276_01/html/programmer_reference/transapp_atomicity.html">
atomicity</a> means that the effects of the transaction are
indivisible, and either occur fully, should the transaction be
included, or not at all. To give a concrete example: Given a
payment transaction of $50 from A to B, atomicity would be violated
if B is credited with $50, but A is not debited the same amount.
This may be caused by a network or power outage. DLTs protect
against this scenario and will only acknowledge inclusion of a
transaction into the ledger if all modifications have been carried
out properly. This may pose significant challenges if, like
Ethereum, a single transaction may trigger a multitude of
constituent modifications to the system’s state. One such example
are <a href=
"https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-flash-loan">flash
loans</a>, where the loaned money is paid, put to use, and repaid
in the same transaction.</p>
<h3>Decentralization</h3>
<p>To explain <em>decentralization</em>, it is useful to
distinguish it from the well-understood concept of distribution. In
computing, a <a href=
"https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds4/">distributed
system</a> refers to a network of autonomous computers that work
together. While the network may span different data centres or even
continents, control is typically exercised by a single entity, such
as an organization running the system. As Xu et al. point out, in
such a system, “a central authority could manipulate the whole
system”. In contrast, a decentralized system would “devolve
responsibility and capability” to individual participants. For
example, in Bitcoin, the network is structured as follows:
Participants form a peer-to-peer network which anybody can join.
While everybody in the network receives new blocks of the chain and
new pending transactions, some participants choose to also
contribute computing power in the process known as <em>mining</em>.
Those participants continuously solve a mathematical challenge that
results in a new block being added approximately every ten minutes,
and in turn, transactions being included in the ledger.
Statistically, every individual participant will create new blocks
at a rate that is proportional to their fraction of compute power
compared to the whole network. Other networks like Ethereum use a
different system, where block formation depends on reserving some
holdings as a <em>stake</em>. But in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the
set of participants in potentially unbounded, and everyone “gets a
say”. This is referred to as <em>permissionless</em>. In contrast,
some DLTs may restrict membership on various criteria. This is
referred to as a <em>permissioned</em>. In cases where the set of
participants is well-known, there are typically legal arrangements
in place that codify the operation of the system. This is referred
to as a <a href=
"https://hal.science/hal-02271063"><em>consortium</em></a>
blockchain or distributed ledger. Depending on the degree of
decentralization, distributed ledgers often enjoy <a href=
"https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/decentralization-in-blockchain/">
high resilience</a>, because they can continue operating even in
the face of network failures, which is ensured by consensus (see
next paragraph).</p>
<h3>Consensus</h3>
<p>Closely related to decentralization, consensus refers to the
algorithm that is used by the participants to collaborate. As an
example, assume that there are five computers, each under
individual control by different entities, that are allowed to
validate transactions and append them to the ledger. Each computer
keeps its own copy of the ledger (the “D” in “DLT”). If a
transaction is submitted, they need to arrive at a common verdict
about its validity, and later, to ensure that the ledger is updated
uniformly across the system. From a computer science perspective,
the challenge is to maintain immutability and atomicity in a system
where participants may not trust each other. To solve this problem,
multiple <em>consensus algorithms</em> are known that, in essence,
allow all participants in a distributed system to arrive at a
common view of the system. A particular subcategory of these
algorithms that do not assume mutual trust between participants is
called <em>Byzantine consensus</em>. Under normal circumstances,
when everyone adheres to the same protocol, consensus will be
achieved easily. In case of disagreements, a fork might occur,
where the network participants are split into two groups which may
have differing views over the state of the ledger. Reasons for
disagreements include not just malicious actors, but also
(temporary) network outages. Such forks would, if ever, rarely
occur in consortium arrangements, where disagreements can be
resolved through legal proceedings (<a href=
"https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/perspectives-events/publications/2022/04/key-considerations-when-joining-a-blockchain-consortium">governance</a>).</p>
<h3>Incentivization</h3>
<p>Participants in a distributed ledger system may spend a
considerable amount of computing power to validate transactions and
append them to the ledger. This is especially true in Proof-of-Work
systems like Bitcoin. Therefore, these participants need to be
<em>incentivized</em>, for example by financial gains, to
contribute. More specifically, the incentive structure must be set
up to reward correct behaviour and punish protocol violations.
Cryptocurrencies typically incentivize their participants through a
combination of transaction fees and minting (<a href=
"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539604">reward</a>). In more
restricted settings such as consortium ledgers, incentive structure
can be <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work924_2101.pdf">more
subtle</a>, and range from intrinsic motivation of participants
towards legal agreements.</p>
<h2>Conclusion & Outlook</h2>
<p>In this post, I have introduced the key terminology of
distributed ledger and blockchains, as well as their key
characteristics. Distributed ledgers ensure immutability, meaning
once a transaction is included in the ledger, it cannot be removed.
Atomicity is another characteristic, ensuring that the effects of a
transaction are indivisible and either fully occur or not at all.
Decentralization refers to the devolution of responsibility and
capability to individual participants, while consensus is the
algorithm used by participants to collaborate and maintain a common
view of the system. Incentivization is important to motivate
participants to contribute to the system. The next part of this
series will be about smart contracts and programmability. Together,
this will pave the way for a deeper understanding of the
applicability of DLTs to a CBDC implementation.</p>
<h2>Notes & References</h2>
<p><strong>Pruning.</strong> Some distributed ledgers allow for
pruning procedures, where the actual transaction data can be
removed, but the full system state is retained and can always be
verified through cryptographic hashes. Pruning therefore
corresponds to compressing the ledger data, not to undoing
transactions. One specific example for this is the way Ethereum
uses Merkle trees for state roots. For further reading, see the
articles <a href=
"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00009">“Selective Blockchain
Transaction Pruning and State Derivability”</a> and <a href=
"https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/11/15/merkling-in-ethereum">“Merkling
in Ethereum”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Permissioned DLTs.</strong> Restrictions to join the
network can refer to permissions to initiate, read, validate, and
write transactions. Examples of systems that have broad permissions
to initiate and read, but not validate and write, are Hedera
Hashgraph and Ripple (sometimes referred to as <em>public
permissioned</em>). Systems that are typically used to operate in a
fully restricted fashion are Hyperledger Fabric and Corda. In
Corda, it is further possible to narrow down access to the system
state further within the already restricted set of participants, so
that participants enjoy privacy from each other.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus.</strong> Byzantine consensus algorithms are a
necessary prerequisite for cryptocurrencies, where participants are
anonymous and have no reason to trust each other. It can
successfully establish consensus given more than 50% of honest
participants. Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm is based on
Proof-of-Work and is often referred to as Nakamoto consensus. A
weaker subcategory of consensus algorithm is called crash-fault
tolerant consensus and cannot deal with malicious participants, but
with routine network outages or storage failures. For further
reading, see the articles <a href=

Ledger Technology&nbsp;Characteristics”</a>.</p>
