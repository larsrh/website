<p>Much has been written about different technical implementation
options of central bank digital currencies. Often, the use of DLT
is proposed. It appears that the choice in favour or against DLT is
so fundamental, that the <a href="https://cbdctracker.org/"
>CBDC Tracker</a> even has it as a dedicated category. Yet,
I often observe a lack of clarity about what DLTs are, what they
can provide, and how that relates to the desired characteristics of
a CBDC. In this series, I want to examine these topics in more
detail. Part 2 is about smart contracts and programmability.</p>
<h2>What are smart contracts?</h2>
<p>In this part, I will introduce one more building block towards
understanding DLTs. Some distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum,
provide the capability to deploy and run <em>smart contracts</em>.
The oft-cited definition by Nick Szabo – who also coined the term
itself – goes as follows: a smart contract is “a set of promises,
specified in digital form, including protocols within which the
parties perform on these promises”. This definition predates public
blockchains, and Bitcoin specifically, which is why it does not
reference (distributed) ledgers. Arguably, Ethereum, which was
introduced in 2013, refined and popularized the concept of
distributed ledgers. Simply put, instead of a simple definition of
transactions that merely move assets from A to B, Ethereum
introduces two new kinds of transactions: creating a smart contract
and executing a smart contract. With the benefit of hindsight, Xu
et al. define smart contracts as “programs deployed as data in the
blockchain ledger and executed in transactions on the blockchain”.
Crucially, these programs are “immutable once deployed”.</p>

</figure>
<p>Consequently, Ethereum’s distributed ledger does not just manage
individuals’ holdings of one particular asset, but arbitrary state.
For example, the <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name
Service</a> manages domain names ending in “.eth”, which can be
registered by anyone and easily transferred between users. The
blockchain records not just the owner of a domain name, but also
the websites they point to. Since there is no monopoly on creating
smart contracts, anyone could easily start a clone or fork of this
domain system.</p>
<p>In practice, the data managed by smart contracts is typically
organized around the concepts of “ownership” and “assets”.
Therefore, we can think of Ethereum participants as having a set of
assets, with smart contracts governing their transfer, usage, and
governance. Note that Bitcoin also has smart contract capabilities,
but they are intentionally restricted and are therefore not
powerful enough to establish secondary assets on the network.</p>
<h2>Case study: Stablecoins</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most popular application of smart contracts are
<em>stablecoins</em>, which denotes a particular class of digital
asset, managed in smart contracts, and whose value is “pegged, or
tied, to that of another currency, commodity or financial
instrument” (<a href=
"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp">Investopedia</a>).
They are issued by private entities which exchange stablecoins for
deposit money on par, and need to retain sufficiently much
liquidity to maintain the peg. Technically, they are implemented as
a smart contract created by the issuing entity, which exerts full
control over the money supply, but allowing any holders to transact
freely.</p>
<p>Comparisons of stablecoins to e-money are often drawn, with the
conclusion that there are large differences, due to e-money’s lack
of interoperability.26 Stablecoins are primarily used as a <a href=
"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-stable-in-stablecoins-20221216.html">
medium of exchange</a>, serving as the preferred instrument to
settle the cash leg of cryptocurrency exchanges, but also as a
temporary store of value on exchanges. This is due to a combination
of two reasons: their promise of seamless trading on blockchains,
and prohibitive fees on exchanges for cash-in and cash-out
transactions. The two largest stablecoins, Tether and USD Coin,
both denoted in US Dollar, have a combined market capitalization of
$112 billion, with Tether boasting an average daily trading volume
of $41.6 billion in March 2023 (based on CoinMarketCap data).</p>
<h2>How do smart contracts relate to DLT?</h2>
<p>Despite the relative age of Szabo’s definition of smart
contracts, they are often associated with DLT, or even declared to
be one of their defining characteristics. However, smart contracts
– or more broadly, programming capabilities – can also be <a href=
"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-is-programmable-money-20210623.html">
considered independently of the nature of the ledger</a>. In
reference to central bank digital currency, there is often a
distinction being made between <em>programmable money</em> and
<em>programmable payments</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There appears to be broad agreement that programmable money
refers to an Ethereum- or Bitcoin-like system where the “the value
represented in those systems and the programmability of that value
are tightly integrated” (Alexander Lee, FEDS Notes). In other
words, there is no technical means to spend assets governed by a
smart contract without following the rules of the contract; the
execution of which is validated through the blockchain protocol by
all participants in the network. In other words, there is a
guaranteed coherence between the asset and the rules controlling
its use. While permissioned or consortium ledgers often diverge
significantly in design from their public counterparts, they all
follow this philosophy to a differing extent. For example, in
Hyperledger Fabric, contract execution is separated from the
inclusion of the transaction in the ledger (see below for
details).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This contrasts with programmable payments, which refers to the
ability to transact digital money based on code. Obviously, this
has been possible for a long time: “digital money as a product has
existed in many forms for years, as has the ability to write
computer software” (Alexander Lee, FEDS Notes). Smart contracts
would not fall into this category, but rather traditional financial
products that can be accessed through APIs.</p>
<h2>The oracle problem</h2>
<p>Some smart contract platforms, especially on public DLTs, have a
bothersome restriction. Since coherence dictates that the execution
of a contract is tied to the validation of a transaction, and any
participant of the DLT should be able to validate a transaction, by
definition, smart contracts can only depend on information that is
submitted as part of the transaction or is historically part of the
ledger. In other words, information that is external to the system
cannot be considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate this issue: A smart contract in Ethereum cannot
include the current weather or the stock price of a company in its
computation. Instead, it can include current balances of Ethereum
addresses, number of blocks that have been created so far, or the
current time (although not exact, since clocks are not perfectly
synchronized across the network).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, external information such as the current stock price
of a company can be fed to the ledger through other means, because
Ethereum transactions can have an arbitrary format. This is
referred to as an <a href=
"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/oracles/"><em>oracle</em></a>.
Depending on the underlying distributed ledger, oracles may
actively supply real-time information, or react based on requests
from users or smart contracts. But no matter the implementation,
they can be considered to be trusted third parties that some or all
of the network participants must rely on. In public
cryptocurrencies, this is not workable due to their decentralized
and trustless nature, therefore, relying on external information is
next to impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissioned systems such as Fabric forgo this issue – as
discussed above – by decoupling contract execution from validation.
The nodes executing contracts can access arbitrary resources and
perform arbitrary computation. Afterwards, they generate a signed
set of changes to the contract state that is then passed on to the
validating nodes. Depending on configuration, a certain quorum of
execution nodes must be presented, otherwise the transaction is
rejected by the system. However, this also leads to weaker
coherence guarantees, since it is not always possible to confirm
the result of a contract execution independently.</p>
<h2>Code is Law? Risks of smart contracts</h2>
<p>Taken to the extreme, combining the notion of coherence with
immutability implies a perhaps undesired consequence: Transactions
that are generated through smart contracts are irreversible, even
though they may have been unintentional. Even with simple payment
transactions, there is a risk of e.g., mistyping the recipient. If
there is complex programming logic attached to transactions, it is
easy to see that the risk of accidental consequences increases
manyfold. The reason for that is fundamental and well-understood:
Smart contracts are programmes, and programmes may have bugs, i.e.,
mismatches between the actual code and the intentions behind the
code. This is perhaps why David G. W. Birch <a href=
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2021/09/04/theyre-not-smart-and-theyre-not-contacts/">
emphasizes that smart contracts</a> are “not smart and […] not
contracts”.</p>
<p>This is a real concern in public blockchains, such as Ethereum.
For example, in 2017, a bug in a popular wallet contract led to
<a href=
"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/accidental-bug-may-have-frozen-280-worth-of-ether-on-parity-wallet.html">
$280 million worth of assets being frozen</a> indefinitely. Such
problems appear routinely. Because of the high level of privacy in
cryptocurrencies, exploiters rarely have to expect criminal
proceedings, making <a href=
"https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1641114/1641114.pdf">smart
contracts a prime target</a>. A particularly spectacular
counterexample is the 2022 exploit on blockchain bridge Wormhole.
An attacker “stole” $325 million worth of cryptocurrency but did
not proceed to withdraw or convert those to actual US Dollar.
Instead, about a year later, the attacker moved the funds to a
smart contract operating the Oasis protocol, in an attempt to use
the assets for betting. Based on a UK court order, the creator of
that smart contract leveraged an (intentional) backdoor in its
programming to <a href=
"https://blockworks.co/news/jump-crypto-wormhole-hack-recovery">return
the funds to where they were stolen from</a>: the operator of the
Wormhole bridge. The paradoxical nature of immutable code with
backdoors has been noted in the industry, <a href=
"https://blockworks.co/news/jump-crypto-wormhole-hack-recovery">pointing
out that</a> “while it’s good to stop hackers, these tools can be
quickly turned against the industry, and it’s not worth the price”
(Adam Cochran).</p>
<p>Even if we disregard malicious attacks, there is a more subtle
issue at play, which is embodied by the catchphrase “code is law”.
Reinterpreted from its original meaning that predates blockchains,
some now take it as a defence “against claims that they have acted
wrongly and argue that they are simply using technically complex
rules to […] obtain outcomes (like wealth) that others did not
believe could or would occur” (<a href=
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/05/17/code-is-law-during-the-age-of-blockchain/">John
Quinn</a>). In other words, the smart contract programming and the
underlying execution logic guaranteed by the blockchain is the
single source of truth, and sits supreme over a country’s
legislation. The Wormhole hackback, triggered by a national court,
affecting a global, anonymous cryptocurrency, only further
demonstrates that governments do not agree with this dogma. This
brings another paradoxical situation, in which it needs to be
explained that basic functions of a financial system, such as
dispute resolution, <a href=
"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10978-018-9224-0">would need to be
present</a> in any legally acceptable DLT ecosystem, especially
when it is utilized in consumer-facing activities. Having said
that, the legal assessment changes towards a more positive outlook
when smart contracts are used for process automation in business
contexts, where no consumers are involved. Typically, jurisdictions
allow a higher degree of freedom for B2B than B2C contracts. Yet,
even those business arrangements are subject to litigation in case
of disagreements.</p>
<h2>Conclusion & Outlook</h2>
<p>In this post, I have described the workings of smart contracts
and how it relates to the term programmability. Some systems
guarantee coherence, whereby the ledger itself guarantees that
assets are only spent through the rules governing it. This poses a
serious trade-off, which means that coherence is not universally
desirable, especially in central bank digital currencies.
Furthermore, the question whether coherence could be achieved
without DLTs is still unanswered. I will revisit these points in a
later part.</p>
<h2>Notes & References</h2>
<p><strong>Stablecoin peg.</strong> There are different ways a
stablecoin’s peg is ensured, for example through low-risk
collateral such as treasury bills, or algorithmically by tying the
asset to some other (perhaps volatile) asset. Some of these pegs
have failed historically, creating the cryptocurrency-flavoured
equivalent of a bank run.</p>
