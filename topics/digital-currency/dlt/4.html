<p>Much has been written about different technical implementation
options of central bank digital currencies. Often, the use of DLT
is proposed. It appears that the choice in favour or against DLT is
so fundamental, that the <a href="https://cbdctracker.org/"
>CBDC Tracker</a> even has it as a dedicated category. Yet,
I often observe a lack of clarity about what DLTs are, what they
can provide, and how that relates to the desired characteristics of
a CBDC. In this series, I want to examine these topics in more
detail. Part 4 explains what how CBDC is defined and compares it
with other electronic payment systems.</p>

<h2>Central Bank Digital Currency in a nutshell</h2>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/study-shows-130-countries-exploring-central-bank-digital-currencies-2023-06-28/"
>vast majority of central banks</a> around the world
are investigating or piloting a <em>Central Bank Digital
Currency</em>, or <em>CBDC</em> for short, with a <a href=
"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.pdf"
>select few already running live systems</a>. Although
there is no single universal definition of CBDC as of writing, it
is commonly understood to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a digital representation of a country’s or region’s
existing currency:</strong> this means that the CBDC will be
denoted in the same currency and be 1:1 exchangeable for other
types of money, such as deposit money, in a way that resembles
cash;</li>
<li><strong>issued directly by the central bank:</strong> unlike
deposit money and e-money, which is issued by private entities,
CBDC represents a direct claim on the issuing central bank and
therefore, the central bank has full control over its supply;</li>
<li><strong>usable in electronic payments:</strong> unlike cash,
which can only be used for payments in physical proximity, CBDC as
digital money can be used both offline and online; and</li>
<li><strong>legal tender:</strong> the ability to use CBDC for any
purpose and to discharge monetary obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>While not strictly speaking necessary according to the above
definition, CBDC payments are usually expected to be settled
instantly. In terms of accessibility, there are two types of CBDC
that need to be distinguished. <em>Retail CBDC</em> can be used by
anyone in the country, whereas <em>Wholesale CBDC</em> is only
available for <a href=
"https://bankingblog.accenture.com/cbdc-retail-wholesale-international-payments"
>regulated financial intermediaries</a>. The name
refers to the idea that the former allows for retail payments,
whereas the latter would be used mainly by financial
institutions.</p>
<p>Let us now compare CBDC to existing instruments. Note that due
to the lack of widespread experience with CBDC, many of its
properties are currently only technically proven, but not
necessarily economically.</p>

<p>As it becomes obvious from this comparison, one of the reasons
central banks attempt to design retail CBDC is to combine
advantages of the other instruments. (Note that I have omitted some
instruments such as mobile wallets from the table for brevity.) For
the remainder of this essay, I will focus on retail CBDC.</p>
<h2>Technical requirements for CBDC</h2>
<p>Based on the above characteristics, many different technical
implementations are possible; however, it is clear that a system
that is poised to process a significant share of a country’s
payment volume, needs to meet high security and resilience criteria
(among others).</p>
<p>Bank of England staffers have already <a href=
"https://bankunderground.co.uk/2017/09/13/beyond-blockchain-what-are-the-technology-requirements-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency/"
>proposed such criteria in 2017</a> (quoted
verbatim):</p>
<ul>
<li>High operational availability (&gt;99.999%)</li>
<li>Secure against cyberattacks</li>
<li>Potential for several thousand transactions per second</li>
<li>Near-instantaneous, real-time transaction processing, with
settlement finality</li>
<li>Private, but not anonymous</li>
<li>Interoperable with existing systems and other CBDCs</li>
<li>Enable the overlay of innovative features/services</li>
<li>Ability to upgrade and enhance, without impacting service</li>
</ul>
<p>Those criteria are still present – and further elaborated upon –
in the Bank of England’s 2023 <a href=
"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-technology-working-paper"
>technology working paper</a> on the digital pound.
Most notably, the bank now “estimates that approximately 30,000
transactions per second may be the necessary level of performance
needed”, with further explorations towards “more ambitious
capabilities of […] 100,000 transactions per second”.</p>
<p>While details, e.g. concrete figures, differ across the working
or design papers of various central banks, by and large, they are
similar. However, there are stark differences regarding the
issuance model which deserve some further explanation.</p>
<h2>How is CBDC issued?</h2>
<p>The <em>Bank for International Settlements (BIS)</em>
distinguishes between <a href=
"https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2003j.pdf"
>three different issuance models</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Direct CBDC.</strong> The digital money is issued by
the central banks, which also manages user holdings and retail
payments. The role of intermediaries is limited.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid CBDC.</strong> As in the direct model, digital
money is issued by the central banks, but most other
responsibilities are delegated to intermediaries, such as
onboarding and user interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect (or synthetic) CBDC.</strong> As opposed to
the other two models, digital money held by users is a claim on the
intermediary. Issuance is still controlled by the central bank,
because any intermediary wishing to distribute digital money to
their customers must submit sufficiently much reserve balance.</li>
</ol>
<p>These models are ordered by decreasing involvement of the
central bank, and closely related, increasing need for supervision
of intermediaries.</p>
<h2>Roles & responsibilities across a CBDC ecosystem</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work948.pdf"
>In a later publication</a>, BIS further differentiates the
second model in terms of whether retail payments are processed by
the central bank or by intermediaries. In the latter case, the
central bank only “sees” wholesale payments, exhibiting similarity
to a wholesale CBDC. Perhaps more interesting is that Auer and
Böhme no longer classify the indirect model as a retail CBDC, but
rather as “fully backed payment accounts or stablecoins”.</p>

  </ul>
</details>

<p>If we give up the notion of clear technical separation between
the different issuance models, and instead consider them on a
spectrum, we can focus on common themes of governance, before
moving on to assessing DLT’s appropriateness for implementing
CBDC.</p>
<h2>CBDC vs. stablecoins</h2>
<p>There is common understanding across central banks that
governance and operation of CBDC falls purely within a limited set
of regulated entities. As opposed to traditional deposits, many
non-banks can hold CBDC, to increase competition within the payment
landscape for the benefit of end users.</p>
<p>This is comparable to stablecoins. The major stablecoin issuers
Tether (USDT), Circle (USDC), and others, follow a centralized
governance approach. The issuer is responsible for cash-in and
cash-out transactions, as well as ensuring that there are always
sufficiently much backing assets (collateral) to match the
circulating supply of the stablecoin.</p>
<p>However, since USDT, USDC, and others are issued as smart
contracts on Ethereum (and other smart contract-capable
blockchains), stablecoin holders can transact in a decentral manner
without intermediaries. They are also integrated into AMMs
(automated market makers, see previous part) and can be therefore
traded for other types of assets. Any interested user can also
build their own smart contract logic to transact with stablecoins,
such as implementing recurring payments.</p>
<p>This gives rise to an interesting combination of centralization
and decentralization: a fully centralized instrument that uses a
fully decentralized platform. A hypothetical CBDC that is issued in
a similar way would therefore satisfy certain (centralized)
governance requirements.</p>
<p>But the decentralized aspect of the underlying distributed
ledger still poses a problem. The central bank would have no
control over the evolution of the protocol, potential forks, or
double-spending attacks. For example, consider a hypothetical
protocol change that would negatively impact a particular token but
is accepted by the majority of miners. The token-issuing entity has
no way of vetoing that change, effectively yielding control over
the token to an anonymous set of stakeholders.</p>
<p>This also leads us to the second point: this plurality of
anonymous blockchain participants that together form a consensus
about whether or not a transaction is valid. In offline scenarios,
there is by definition no connectivity to the ledger, therefore
rendering consensus impossible. Offline payments only work if we
can assume a basic level of trust between participants, where the
trust may be established through hardware security. This goes
counter to the idea of public distributed ledgers.</p>
<p>From this, we can conclude that public blockchains, like those
employed by stablecoins, are not desirable for CBDCs.</p>
<h2>CBDC vs. deposits</h2>
<p>As of today, deposit money is already electronic. It can be used
for online payments, and to a limited extent, also offline (for
example with contactless cards). But unlike central bank money,
deposit money is issued by individual banks. That means that
transfers from an account at bank A to a bank account at bank B may
involve an additional settlement step, where bank A pays bank B the
equivalent amount in central bank reserves. Conversely, if a
payment happens between accounts in the same bank, it can be
settled inside the bank (referred to as <em>on-us
transactions</em>).</p>
<p>Some banks have investigated tokenizing deposits, i.e., defining
a common standard for a digital representation of their
privately-issued money. Such a solution would entail:</p>
<ul>
<li>support of multiple issuers in the same system,</li>
<li>the ability of users to transact across issuers,</li>
<li>the ability of issuers to redeem each other’s tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>The precise mechanics differ. In the <a href=
"https://regulatedliabilitynetwork.org/"
><em>Regulated Liabilities Network</em></a> <em>(RLN)</em>
proposal, there is a wholesale token that represents central bank
reserves, closely mirroring the working of current inter-bank
settlement systems. In <a href=
"https://die-dk.de/en/topics/article/new-working-paper-on-commercial-bank-money-token/"
>another proposal</a>, the German Banking Industry
Committee (<em>Die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft</em>) has sketched
exchange algorithms based on atomic swaps of each other’s tokens,
possibly across different ledgers.</p>
<p>Yet, the same questions about stablecoins remain for tokenized
deposits. Governance would need to be decentralized; otherwise,
where is the material difference to traditional reserve accounts?
But then, would a central bank be willing to participate in such a
system? Also, since the tokens are issued from multiple entities,
they are not truly interoperable, therefore restricting flexibility
and preventing offline payment use cases.</p>
<p>Based on these considerations, the design space for CBDC is
restricted further. Even a permissioned distributed ledger where
multiple banks are members and can exert control over settlement
will not be appropriate for a CBDC.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>CBDC shares some aspects with other electronic payment systems,
stablecoins, and deposits. However, the combination is unique:
issued by the central bank, directly accessible for users, and
offline-capable. To some extent, this simplifies matters, because
today’s typical settlement routines often involve multiple
intermediaries and therefore multiple kinds of money. But on the
other hand, it also restricts the design decisions: decentralized
governance, key feature of DLTs (as argued in earlier parts of this
series), is detrimental to a CBDC. Is there anything left? What
about programmability, privacy, performance? I will explore that in
the next and final part of this series.</p>
<h2>Notes & References</h2>
<p><strong>CBDC definition.</strong> There are plenty of references
on the definition of CBDC. For example, consider the high-level
introductions by <a href=
"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc"
>McKinsey</a> and <a href=
"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp"
>Investopedia</a>. There is ongoing debate in the
literature whether the concept of wholesale CBDC is novel, e.g.,
with <a href=
"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220926~5f9b85685a.en.html"
>Fabio Panetta</a> likening it to central bank
reserve accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Legal tender.</strong> While retail CBDC is typically
expected to become legal tender, it is important to clarify what
that means. Legal tender can increase trust in currency, but does
not relate to general payments. For example, merchants could refuse
cash payments, even though it is legal tender.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy and anonymity.</strong> There are varying levels
of privacy in cryptocurrencies, typically ranging from pseudonymity
to anonymity. For technical explanations, see also <a href=
