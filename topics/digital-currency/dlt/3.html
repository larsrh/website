<p>Much has been written about different technical implementation
options of central bank digital currencies. Often, the use of DLT
is proposed. It appears that the choice in favour or against DLT is
so fundamental, that the <a href="https://cbdctracker.org/"
>CBDC Tracker</a> even has it as a dedicated category. Yet,
I often observe a lack of clarity about what DLTs are, what they
can provide, and how that relates to the desired characteristics of
a CBDC. In this series, I want to examine these topics in more
detail. Part 3 is about a popular application of DLT:
cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2>Distributed ledgers for cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>Distributed ledgers provide a few characteristics that make it
an ideal basis for cryptocurrencies. Xu et al. define
cryptocurrency as the “base currencies of blockchains”. In Bitcoin,
the term “Bitcoin” refers to both the blockchain itself and its
currency. Ethereum calls its currency <em>Ether</em>, and also
allows for other assets to be defined on top of its platform via
smart contracts.</p>
<p>According to Andreas Antonopoulos, <a href=
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/andreas-antonopoulos-thinks-open-blockchains-153046668.html"
>the five pillars of public, permissionless
blockchains</a> are: “open, public, borderless, neutral, and
censorship-resistant”. It is not hard to see that a decentralized
network, using both a consensus algorithm that assumes no trust
between participants, and an incentivization structure that rewards
honest participation, can deliver on those pillars. To that extent,
cryptocurrencies are a perfect match for the guarantees assured by
distributed ledger technology.</p>

</figure>
<p>In this part, I will examine how the main characteristics of
DLTs that I have introduced earlier – namely, atomicity,
immutability, decentralization, consensus, and incentivization –
are practically applied in cryptocurrencies, using Bitcoin and
Ethereum as examples. It should become clear that many of those
considerations are only useful in cryptocurrencies and do not
necessarily carry over to more centralized systems. Note that I
will exclude the question about practical applications of
cryptocurrencies themselves here.</p>
<h2>Atomicity & Immutability</h2>
<p>To start out, <strong>atomicity</strong> is guaranteed in
Bitcoin. Its built-in scripting language allows for some
non-trivial transactions to be carried out atomically, for example
requiring multiple signatures to sign off a payment, or funds that
can only be unlocked within a specified time window. Due to
Ethereum’s extensive smart contract capabilities, transactions can
combine many different steps, giving strong atomicity guarantees.
Ethereum’s ecosystem has inspired many others, with its virtual
machine forming the basis of other smart contract platforms.</p>
<p>As for <strong>immutability</strong>, there has been no known
incident of a transaction being undone in the public Bitcoin
network, presumably due to the sheer amount of compute power needed
to carry out such a process (a successful attack would need to
expend at least as much compute power as has been used for creating
every block since the transaction that should be undone).
Transaction reversals are also unlikely in Ethereum, which is
second in size after Bitcoin (as of June 2023). Note that a
reversal to refund users has happened in the aftermath of the DAO
hack, but this was only possible because the vast majority of the
community agreed on it.</p>
<p>But this also means that smaller cryptocurrencies are much more
prone to reversing transactions, therefore negating immutability.
The Bitcoin SV fork of Bitcoin has suffered <a href=
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/08/04/bitcoin-fork-suffers-massive-51-attack-in-attempt-to-destroy-the-cryptocurrency-sending-its-price-sharply-lower/"
>such an attack</a> as recent as 2021. While details
of such attacks differ, a main goal is to get a transaction
confirmed, then reverse it to re-obtain the funds being spent in
exchange for other assets or services <em>(<a href=
"https://blog.goodaudience.com/what-is-a-51-attack-or-double-spend-attack-aa108db63474"
>double spending</a>)</em>.</p>
<h2>Decentralization</h2>
<p>Both Bitcoin and Ethereum – like most cryptocurrencies – are
examples of highly <strong>decentralized</strong> systems, both in
terms of participation and governance. The consensus mechanisms
employed (to which I will come back later) ensure that any
interested person with an internet connection can take part in
creating and transacting cryptocurrency, but also shaping the
future direction of the system. For example, in the past, there
have been multiple occasions where miners would “vote” on proposed
changes, by indicating their opinion in the blocks that they have
created.</p>
<p>Yet, cryptocurrencies experience a few re-centralization
problems, of which I would like to highlight three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mining centralization.</strong> It is well-known that
energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus tends to be carried out in
regions with cheap electricity. That means that compute power
accumulates much heavier in energy “hot spots”. For many years,
this used to be China, but since regulatory changes came into
effect in 2021 that drastically cut down Bitcoin mining, the United
States <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map"
>has taken over</a>. From that time until January 2022, the
US has continuously controlled more compute power than China.
However, no other country has yet exerted over 50% control, down
from the 75% control in China in September 2019 (according to the
Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index). It is easy to see
how a country’s legal system can hold a firm grip over a
cryptocurrency, should mining be heavily concentrated in its own
jurisdiction. Besides government control, another aspect is
centralization due to <em>mining pools</em>. Since individual
participants mining for cryptocurrency may need to invest
prohibitively large amounts of electricity before their payoff,
pools will bundle many participants and ensure a steady flow of
fractional payoffs, distributed across their members. As of April
2023, the two largest Bitcoin mining pools <a href=
"https://cryptoslate.com/behind-the-two-mining-pools-controlling-51-percent-of-the-global-hash-rate/"
>control over 50% of the network</a>. This is not a
new problem, with many observers voicing concerns. The most
egregious case happened in 2014, where a single pool <a href=
"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/16/bitcoin-currency-destroyed-51-attack-ghash-io"
>exceeded 50% of compute power</a>. Arguably, mining
centralization caused by pools poses a more significant threat than
if it were caused by governments; yet both problems remain. As a
comparison, Ethereum has switched to a less energy-intensive
Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol in <a href=
"https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/">September
2022</a>. Control over the network is no longer based on compute
power, but on the amount of capital staked, i.e., locked and
unavailable for spending. Like Bitcoin, there are staking pools
that provide similar benefits to their members, compared to mining
pools. As of April 2023, the largest staking pool currently manages
33% of all staked Ether. However, only 15% of all circulating
Ethereum supply is staked.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange centralization.</strong> In March 2023, daily
trading of Bitcoin vs. US Dollar averaged $28.5 billion, ranging
between $11.2 billion (March 4) and $54.6 billion (March 14).
Ethereum trading is less than that, but still significant, ranging
from $4 billion to $16 billion daily over the same time period.
According to various data sources, centralized cryptocurrency
exchange Binance is by far the largest in the world, <a href=
"https://research.kaiko.com/insights/the-binance-effect"
>dominating the market</a> with about 54% of trading volume
(as of early 2023). In Messari’s exchange rating, only two out of
the Top 20 exchanges are decentralized. While decentralized
exchanges are at a disadvantage regarding the markets they can
serve – by their nature, they cannot cash in from or cash out to
national currencies – even the volume of cryptocurrency/stablecoin
pairs are dwarfed by the dominant players Binance, Coinbase, OKX,
and Upbit. Those four combined account for approximately 80% of the
market volume on centralized exchanges. Even in a hypothetical
situation where decentralized exchanges gain more traction for
cryptocurrency/stablecoin pairs like Bitcoin/Tether, the problem of
centralisation is merely shifted to the stablecoin issuer. Needless
to say, the stablecoin market is also highly centralized. It is
easy to see how the structure of this system thwarts
cryptocurrency’s claimed decentralization. Additionally, even
decentralized exchanges suffer from centralization for <a href=
"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102251"
>similar reasons</a> as outlined in “mining
centralization”.</li>
<li><strong>Software and hardware centralization.</strong> To
manage cryptocurrencies, some kind of wallet software and/or
hardware is required. Additionally, for mining, many
cryptocurrencies demand special hardware for efficiency. Both of
these aspects suffer from centralization. For software, some
factors that drive centralization are: the small number of
independent client software implementations, the relative
popularity of escrow wallets compared to self-custody wallets, and
operation of outdated software. All are described in detail in a
<a href=
"https://www.trailofbits.com/documents/Unintended_Centralities_in_Distributed_Ledgers.pdf"
>2022 report</a> commissioned by DARPA. Especially
the first one has real consequences, as demonstrated by an <a href=
"https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/perspectives-events/publications/2023/02/stolen-crypto-uk-court-of-appeal-opens-door-to-software-developers-legal-duties-to-users"
>ongoing UK court case</a>. There, a plaintiff is
claiming a loss of Bitcoin worth approximately £3 billion due to an
alleged theft. Therefore, the plaintiff seeks assistance in
recovering those assets, by demanding that some Bitcoin core
developers modify the Bitcoin software that is in use by the vast
majority of network participants accordingly. If the suit were to
be successful, this would mean that the immutability of the
blockchain is <a href=
"https://www.shlegal.com/insights/the-myth-of-decentralised-governance-of-bitcoin-tulip-trading-ltd-v-van-der-laan"
>effectively being revoked</a>. For hardware, there
have been concerns in the recent past about the availability of
mining chips (e.g. ASICs). Since hardware manufacturing is a
complicated process and the market for such products is much
smaller than typical consumer electronics, this too lends itself
naturally for centralization. Up-to-date numbers are hard to come
by, but at some point, a particular vendor enjoyed an 80% market
share. Attempts by new cryptocurrencies to design their protocol in
such a way as to make mining more attractive on conventional
hardware <a href=
"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/why-centralized-crypto-mining-growing-problem/"
>have not been successful so far</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize, many “unintended centralities” (Sultanik et al.)
arise in public blockchain networks. While <a href=
"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102584">those
effects</a> may not be entirely negative, it stands to reason that
some degree of centralization is unavoidable.</p>
<h2>Consensus & Incentivization</h2>
<p>As described in the first part of the series, participants
contributing resources (such as compute time) to the cryptocurrency
network have to be <strong>incentivized</strong>. In practice, this
incentivization is intricately linked to the
<strong>consensus</strong> protocol. Bitcoin and Ethereum used to
be based on a <em>Proof-of-Work</em> scheme, where blocks are
formed through heavy computation, and the participant that
successfully creates a block receives a certain predefined amount
of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin continues to use Proof-of-Work, Ethereum has since
switched to a <em>Proof-of-Stake</em> scheme. While details differ
across various cryptocurrencies, the core principle stays the same:
To be allowed to form a block, a participant needs to commit (or
stake) a certain amount of cryptocurrencies, turning the
participant into a validator. One such validator may propose a
block, with the other validators checking it, therefore arriving at
a consensus decision. Validators proposing an invalid block lose
their stake. Conversely, honest validators receive remuneration.
This also poses another centralization risk, where wealth may
accumulate in the few hands of early validators.</p>

<p>While both schemes have advantages and disadvantages, they
appear to be working well in practice, delivering on the promise of
forming consensus across an anonymous set of participants. There
are other consensus schemes that are used in practice, such as
Proof-of-Authority, but arguably, they compromise on
decentralization.</p>
<h2>Conclusion & Outlook</h2>
<p>In this post, I have described how the popular cryptocurrencies
Bitcoin and Ethereum leverage DLT to achieve a decentralized
transaction system that guarantees immutability and atomicity,
using specific consensus and incentivization mechanisms. While not
always perfect, distributed ledgers are technologically a good fit
for public cryptocurrencies. The consensus algorithm is precisely
where DLTs shine. Also, their decentralized governance is hailed as
a key benefit by proponents. But for CBDCs, this type of
decentralization poses considerable risks, since they are by
definition issued by central banks. But if you take the
decentralization away, the technology reduces itself to solving the
problem of reliable redundant storage of data, which can be
achieved without DLT. In the next part, I will introduce the main
terminology of CBDC and some common design criteria.</p>
