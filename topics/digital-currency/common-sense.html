<p>In June 2023, the European Commission proposed a <a href=
"https://finance.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-06/230628-proposal-digital-euro-regulation_en.pdf">regulatory framework</a> on the “establishment of
the digital euro”. This is just the latest in a string of pivotal
publications from the European institutions, such as the ECB’s
<a href=
"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews230526.en.html">market research and prototyping exercise</a>.</p>
<p>As a leading solution provider in the retail CBDC space, we are
happy with the key recommendations made by the Commission, which
underlines a common-sense approach for a people-centric design of
the Digital Euro.</p>
<p>While the decision whether to go ahead with the Digital Euro has
not been made yet, the Commission’s <a href=
"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3501"
>Single Currency Package</a> sets the stage for a
more innovative and competitive payment landscape in the future, in
which cash, existing private payment instruments, and the new
Digital Euro will all play a vital role and complement each other.
This is also echoed by the latest <a href=
"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.pdf">BIS
survey</a>, in which over “80% of central banks see potential value
in having both a retail CBDC and a fast payment system”.</p>
<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
<p>But let us now take a brief look at the most important design
considerations, as put forward by the Commission.</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Euro should become legal tender and be
accessible to everyone.</strong> This point is crucial for
adoption. What use would a CBDC be if only affluent adults could
access it? Instead, the focus should be on universal use for
anyone, any purpose, any time. It is especially good to see
explicit mention of minorities, such as people with disabilities,
in the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution and consumer services will be provided by
financial institutions.</strong> Clearly, the ECB wants to ensure a
successful roll-out, but will not be directly involved in
onboarding users. That should be left to the private sector, where
commercial banks are expected to supply Digital Euro wallets and
services. Furthermore, commercial banks are used to onboard
customers, and they already have the necessary capabilities and
processes in place. But to bridge gaps in the market coverage,
other institutions like post offices could also play a vital
role.</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Euro should not bear any interest.</strong>
This is another characteristic that CBDC shares with cash. If it
had negative interest, people would not use it. If it had positive
interest, it would become too attractive compared to deposits.
Neither of those options seem attractive given the current two-tier
financial system.</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Euro should work offline from day
one.</strong> In 2021, there were <a href=
"https://www.wsbi-esbg.org/number-of-unbanked-adult-eu-citizens-more-than-halved-in-the-last-four-years/"
>13 million unbanked</a> people in the EU. And that
number only includes adult citizens. But what about children,
refugees, or tourists? Offline-capable CBDC wallets that can be
used independently of bank accounts are an important tool for
financial inclusion, and therefore directly benefit the economy.
Additionally, offline payments are crucial for resilience.</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Euro should protect privacy.</strong> With
the European Union having one of the strongest privacy legislations
worldwide, it should not come as a surprise that privacy is a
cornerstone for the Digital Euro. We believe that a combination of
technical and organisational means can provide high degrees of
privacy, for example, by keeping KYC (Know Your Customer) data at
financial institutions.</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Euro should have limits.</strong> For
several reasons, the Commission envisions a holding limit to
prevent excess flow of deposits into Digital Euro. Enforcing those
limits falls within the responsibility of financial institutions,
i.e., the organisations issuing and managing wallets.</p>
<p><strong>It should not be programmable money, but provide
programmable payments.</strong> This did not come as a surprise,
because various officials have made their stance on programmable
money clear in the past. Programmability, such as the features
exhibited by various popular cryptocurrencies, would threaten the
stability of the Digital Euro, and risk user acceptance. However,
some form of automation should be possible, such as payments that
follow certain triggers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, we believe that the proposed Digital Euro design
has <a href=
"https://www.gi-de.com/en/group/press/press-releases/g-d-welcomes-eu-commissions-draft-law-for-the-digital-euro"
>set us on a course</a> for a truly universal,
inclusive means of payment. While the concrete implementation will
be a tall order, we acknowledge that the above points broadly
mirror our learnings from many years of conversations with central
banks around the world. Even more so, our Filia solution checks all
the boxes due to its token-based, privacy-preserving, and
offline-capable architecture. Does this mean we are finally
converging on a common-sense CBDC design? We are hopeful.</p>
