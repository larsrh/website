title: "How I offset carbon emissions"

I have been on a lot of flights in my life, and I continue to fly.
This page is to make transparent my efforts to offset the carbon emissions caused by those flights.

I am aware that reducing carbon emissions is vastly better than offsetting them, which is why I prefer trains and other types of public transit, if available.

## The data

I use a tool to compile a dataset of all flights that I remember taking.
The dataset includes at least departure and arrival airports.
Other than that, the data quality varies:

* Before 2015, the data is based on approximations.
  I am resonably sure that I have covered every flight but collected no further details (e.g. airlines and flight numbers).
* Before 2019, I did not collect the airplane model.
* Since 2019, I collect airplane model and airline.

Those caveats notwithstanding, the data reaches all the way back to age ten.
I'm sure I was on some flights before that, but those are lost in the mists of time.

## The offsetting

I started buying offsets in 2019 and use a variety of providers.
The following are links to statements regarding their methodology:

* [atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/climate-protection-projects/)
* [myclimate](https://www.myclimate.org/en/get-active/climate-protection-projects/)
* [Primaklima](https://www.primaklima.org/projekte/unsere-projekte/)

To cover flights before 2019, I computed the total miles of flight until that time, which came out to 136,237 miles.
I emailed atmosfair and they estimated approximately 64 t of carbon emission, based on an assumed 50/50 split of medium- and long-haul flights.

For flights from 2019, I used atmosfair's calculator to estimate individual emissions, taking into account e.g. airplane model and seat class.

From 2024, I will switch to another set of providers, focusing on buying and cancelling carbon certificates from the European market:

* [Compensators](https://www.compensators.org/en/compensators/)
* [ForTomorrow](https://www.fortomorrow.eu/en)

I am happy about suggestions.

From 2025, offsetting also includes some of my partner's flights.

## The receipts

This table lists all compensations on a rolling basis.
I typically do 2–3 of them a year, batching a few past and/or future flights together.
