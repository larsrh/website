  I thought it'd be fun to collect a list of all conferences I've been to.
  There were a lot of them; at least sixty it seems.
  Maybe we've even crossed paths somewhere.

* May: [JavaOne]({% link _articles/javastars.md %}), San Francisco, US
* December: Sun Tech Days, Frankfurt, Germany

## 2008

* September: [Herbstcampus](https://www.herbstcampus.de/hc08/), Nuremberg, Germany

## 2011

I started giving talks this year.
Topics were weird stuff in Scala's type systems.
In hindsight, I thought the talks were pretty bad, but the organizers let me speak again, so thanks for that!

* March: Mathema Campus, Erlangen, Germany
* September: [Herbstcampus](https://www.herbstcampus.de/hc11/), Nuremberg, Germany

## 2012

I didn't give a talk at Scala Days 2012, but in many ways it was a pivotal conference for me.
I met countless people from the Scala community.
I still remember Erik Osheim explaining specialization to me in a pub near the Barbican (I still know [exactly which pub](https://www.theshakespearebarbican.co.uk/)).

* March: Mathema Campus, Erlangen, Germany
* April: [Scala Days](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1140-scala-days-2012), London, Germany
* September: [Herbstcampus](https://www.herbstcampus.de/hc12/), Nuremberg, Germany

## 2013

The Northeast Scala Symposium was the conference that really kickstarted my speaking career.
It was the first proper talk I gave in English.

* February: [Northeast Scala Symposium](https://nescala.io/2013/), Philadelphia, US
* April: Mathema Campus, Erlangen, Germany

## 2014

This year was pretty wild.
I had a total of fourteen flights.
I was on two academic conferences and gave one keynote at an industrial conference (Scala eXchange).
So far, this was the only keynote I ever gave.

## 2015

2015 was even wilder than 2014.

I had already visited the year before for a week.

* October: Haskell World, Cádiz, Spain

## 2016

Nominally, I was travelling less this year than 2015, but also, I organized two conferences, so I still had plenty to do.
Due to an unlikely coincidence, I visited the lovely Portuguese city of Coimbra for a second time.
