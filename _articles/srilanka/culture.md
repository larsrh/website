  We spent our 2025 holidays in Sri Lanka, going for a hike, culture, and beaches.
  In this third part, we are checking out Batticaloa and Sigiriya.

## Betting on Batticaloa (28.10.---30.10.)

We wanted to see Sri Lanka's west coast, but weren't exactly sure which place to go to.
After some deliberation, we realised that going to see both Trincomalee and Batticaloa would take too much time.
So, we decided to go only to Batticaloa, but stay three nights there.

On the morning of the 28th, as negotiated only two days prior, a driver picked us up to go to Batticaloa.
Initially, we were looking for a shared ride, but the private car came out to 21,000 rupees (approx. € 60), which we deemed a bargain for about four hours of driving.

In the end, the difference between shared and private wasn't all that big, because the training for both bus and car drivers in Sri Lanka appears to put overtaking other vehicles front and centre.
We arrived already at noon.

Our accommodation was nestled in the _Batticaloa Lagoon,_ 56 km long and apparently featuring crocodiles, as the first sign on hotel premises advised.
The room was small but the hotel nice.

We didn't have many plans for the rest of the day.
The _Lonely Planet_ advised to visit the _Dutch Fort,_ so that's what we decided to do.

To get there, we first had to cross the [Kallady Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallady_Bridge) which curiously sports a sign about a city friendship between Munich and Victoria (see picture below).
Which Victoria, and why Munich, was only left to guess.

In the meantime, we were organising (via texting, of course), a bicycle tour for the next day.
It was a little complicated (not a lot of options in that season) but we agreed on an itinerary after a while.

Arriving at the fort, we were “keeping our eyes peeled for the talkative … resident tour guide” _(Lonely Planet)._
Alas, there were nobody to be seen.
What was seen was a bunch of decrepit buildings currently used by the district administration.
Truly a damp squib if I've ever seen one.
We lingered for a few minutes and then returned downtown.

One side quest---getting my tablet computer fixed---I had been putting of since Ella.
So we decided that now was as good time as any, and kept our eyes peeled for a repair shop.
On the way, Vivi spontaneously bought a denim dress (with pockets!) and got her handbag fixed for free by the shopkeeper.

The computer repair was a bust, though, because after explaining that it wouldn't start, it did in fact start.
A trope as old as electronic devices.

We spent the evening back at the hotel, enjoying the food,[^dinner] the swimming pool, and the sunset over the lagoon.

### Cycling tour

The next day, our cycling tour started at 09:00 conveniently close to our hotel.[^shortcut]
Whether they could be more accurately described as rickety or ramshackled is perhaps a pointless debate, but we did get strawhats and helmets.

Our guide navigated us first to a garden where we got an explanation of various fruits and leaves (and their health benefits).
We learned that when Dengue breaks out, pomegranate is the hottest commodity and increases in price massively.

The next stop was at the market, which is close to the Dutch Fort.
My wife and I were already a bit tired due to high temperature: there was no rain for a few days already, as the locals complained.
(This was in stark contrast to our hiking adventures in the hill country.)

The dried fish didn't actually smell too bad and looked very tasty.
(This was in stark contrast to the wet fish on both counts.)

We could try a bunch of things, including something that looked like a blueberry but wasn't.
[_Naval Palam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_cumini) (the Tamil name) has a strong acidic flavour, which is totally different from what you'd expect if you think you are about to eat a blueberry.
Can't say I'm a fan of the stuff.
But the other fruits were great, including the colourful bananas.

Moving on, we went back to the Dutch Fort.
This time---thanks to our guide---we could actually see a bit more.
We climbed the stairs to the top, walking around the building and seeing cannons and the like.
Sadly, the upper floor is also in complete disrepair; making it look almost abandoned.

The final stop before lunch was the _Jumma Masjid,_ where we were invited to observe the noon prayer.
Sri Lanka's Eastern Province has the highest share of Muslim population.
It was a first for both of us to see a mosque from the inside during a religious service.
The imam even came to us for a quick chat afterwards.

Back at the guide's headquarters, the resident nonna had prepared six different curries, one better than the other.
The most difficult part was trying to say no as she kept insisting that we need to eat more.
As we were stuffing ourselves, the guide's boss, a French lady, called.
We were the only customers that month and therefore received a special mission: to catch enough fish in the afternoon to feed her ten cats.

  {% include article_picture.html src="IMG_8121" text="Banana at the market" %}
</div>

In the afternoon, the heat was still intense.
Fortunately, our guide gave us thermoseses with cold water.
We cycled a few kilometers North to the tip of the lagoon, crossing the Munich—Victoria friendship bridge for the fifth time.

There, we visited the lighthouse (only from the outside) and pet some more dogs.
Nearby, a fisherfamily prepared some boats for us: one for fishing and two for observing.
Our concerns about the lagoon crocodiles were dismissed by explaining that they wouldn't be active during daytime.

The lagoon water is very warm, around 28–29 degrees.
We did manage to catch a day's worth of cat food and not get eaten by a crocodile along the way.

</div>

On our way back to the hotel, we noticed an ongoing food festival on the bridge.
We wanted to first change our clothes and then return there, which we did after sunset.

As the only two foreign tourists trying to figure out what to eat (and how to order), we were slightly overwhelmed.
There was a big crowd gathered around one barbecue grill, trying to snatch some grillables.
(Probably because some vendors had already closed shop.)

While I was trying to negotiate with a kid to buy a devilled chicken, Vivi was chatting with some locals.
My wife is normally not the extroverted type, but because we were the only two foreign tourists, the pair (mother and daughter) approached her.
They explained that they have relatives in Munich, so naturally we exchanged numbers.
They were also planning to come to Munich for a relative's wedding.[^visit]

A bunch of locals took photos of us eating; well, mostly me as I was digging into the roasted bird.[^langos]

Afterwards, we went to a nearby restaurant for some further snacks.
The server explained to us that his cousin lives in Augsburg.
I slowly dawned on me: maybe it is the [_Victoria Dam_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Dam_(Sri_Lanka)>) in hill country that the eponymous friendship road refers to?

### More sightseeing

On the 30th, we had no fixed schedule, so we allowed ourselves to sleep in (as much as the heat permitted).

As we were idly browsing possible hotels for our onwards trip to the South, we realised that there isn't actually much to see or do near our original destination of Hambantota.
Nor are there any nice beaches.
I had just booked the flight a few days earlier and could've booked to Koggala instead, which would've been the same price.

As I was being annoyed at myself, I decided to just call Cinnamon Air and see if we could rebook.
We could, at no extra fee.
(We would later learn why.)
Relaxed again, we went to get some breakfast samosas and on a bus south along the lagoon.

We got off in Kattankudy, a Sri Lankan Moors stronghold, to first see the heritage museum.
Some signs were only written in Tamil, but translation apps helped.

From the top of the museum, we could already see the _Al-Aqsa_ mosque, our next stop.
Someone (perhaps the imam) noticed us outside and invited us in.
The tiles outside the mosque were scorchingly hot, which seemed to bother only the two of us.
(You have to take off shoes and socks to enter.)

As the pictures show, both the outside and the inside of the building are impressive.
Since the noon prayer was just over, our impromptu tour guide showed us around.
Much to the interest of the other patrons, I should add, who took selfies with us.

We wrapped up our excursion by walked to Kattankudy's beach, which was completely deserted.
The water was warm, but we didn't bring any swimwear (also, there were no shops open).
We took a tuktuk back to our hotel and had a quick lunch at the same place as yesterday evening.

In the afternoon, we took advantage of our hotel's two attractions.

The first is a [model railway](https://www.facebook.com/battimodelrailway/), lovingly built and maintained by the owner's son.
He's been working on the model purely as a hobby for over a decade.
It is fully computerised and well worth a visit (even when not staying at the hotel).

The second is the lagoon.
We rented a kayak and paddled between the hotel and the Dutch Fort, spending time on the water until sunset.
While we got lucky again by not being eaten by crocodiles, Vivi lost a paddle halfway during the ride.
Still, good fun.

</div>

In the evening we finally saw some other guests at the hotel as well.
We didn't do much else besides having dinner, arranging a tuktuk, and going to sleep, because we had to get up at 05:00 the next morning.

## Shooting for Sigiriya (31.10---01.11.)

[^dinner]: Once again we had to order dinenr well in advance, which seems to be customary in Sri Lanka.

[^shortcut]: There was even a shortcut which required us finding a hidden gate through the hotel's border fence.

[^visit]: The visit is still on the table as I'm writing this, so I'm hopeful!

[^langos]: I seem to be very photogenic while eating. Ask my wife about the picture of me absolutely destroying some Langos in [Hungary]({% link _articles/hiking-slovakia.md %}).
