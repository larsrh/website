As usual, we got up early.
Yet, we were in no rush to get started:
Already during breakfast, it was raining.
We waited for a bit, but the rain didn't subside.

We put on our ponchos and left the hotel at 07:45.
Today was going to be a long hike, as we were planning to complete the full [fifth stage](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-trail/sri-lanka/the-pekoe-trail-stage-05-pundaluoya-to-watagoda-official-profile/800415652/), followed by the first half or so of the [sixth stage](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-trail/sri-lanka/the-pekoe-trail-stage-06-watagoda-to-kotagala-official-profile/800415675/).
(I forgot why we decided that.)
This brought us to a total of about 21.5 km (see also stats below), during most of which it was raining.

Onwards!

Instead of the typical tea plantations that we had seen in earlier stages---and that you would expect on the _Pekoe Trail_---, here, we passed many rice paddies.
The dogs we encountered that day appeared to be more aggressive than usual.
At some point we realised that they might just be barking at the monkeys, who were probably messing with the dogs, mischiveous as they are.

Speaking of fauna:
Passing by, I witnessed a villager picking a leech from her leg.
I greeted her and showed her my leech bites; they were sort of obvious because of the stains on my trousers anyway.
She seemed concerned.
I realised that the locals probably have a smarter leech strategy.
Instead of trying to barricade your skin (the leeches _will_ find the weak spot anyway), they would wear skirts or shorter trousers.
That way, they can see and remove those lil' suckers before they bite.
Just make sure not to stand for too long in one spot while tending to your legs, since those pieces of shit are _fast._
Like, you wouldn't believe _how_ fast.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Side note on leeches</summary>

Harry Williams, [writing in](https://www.sundaytimes.lk/020901/plus/7.html) _Ceylon Pearl of the East_ (1955) about leeches:

> The land leech, happily, dislikes the low country plains of the dry zone and is found only in the damp vegetation and on the edges of swamps. […] It has no legs but possesses a sucker at one end, on which it can erect the whole length of its body which waves about, the four eyes in the thin end searching for oncoming prey. When the creature wishes to move, which it can do at considerable speed, it progresses in a series of loops, using its nose to balance upon while heaving its bulk forward. Having seen its victim, the advance of a leech is a revolting sight. Their strength is that they are not seen or heard---they advance under cover of vegetation and their progress makes no noise at all---and having fastened themselves to their victim, man woman, child or any kind of beast, they can slip through any protective covering. Their initial bite is not noticed, and indeed they often drink their fill of blood and roll off, distended balls, without being noticed. But if one should see them and strike them off, they leave their teeth behind and the result is certain to be a poisoned bite. A lighted match applied to them causes them to curl up, one hopes in agony, and depart, taking their teeth with them.

Despite all that, the trail was quite nice.
We even encountered some [_Choon Pan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choon_Paan) in the middle of nowhere, but sadly, it did not have the samosas we craved on offer.
(There weren't many other people---yet alone tourists---on the trail.)

At around the four-hour mark, i.e. noon, we arrived in Watagoda.
By that time, we must've had four or five cycles of removing and putting on our rain jackets again.
Looking like drowned rats, we had lunch at a small restaurant near the train station.

As we were eating, we considered our options.
Arriving in Watagoda completed the fifth stage, but we had still a few kilometers to go.
We could've also taken the train to reach our destination.

Despite the poor weather, we opted for the hike.
And boy, was that a good decision.
Because shortly after starting the sixth stage, the _real_ fun began.
And with _real_ fun, of course I mean trains.

Because, you see, unbeknownst to us, we had gotten closer to the scenic Kandy---Ella railway line, also known as the [_Main Line._](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Line_(Sri_Lanka)>)
The guide doesn't mention it, but this is primo trainspotting territory.

The railway tracks around Watagoda are very curvy.
And the _Pekoe Trail_ directly [passes by](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1419032391) this stretch.

That day, we had hit the jackpot.
Delay had built up during the day, so a lot of the trains had to meet and/or wait in Watagoda station.
(There are mostly just single tracks.[^token])

Armed with the _RDMNS_ app, we could see three trains (four, if you count the one we saw in the station while passing by).
We waved, and the passengers waved back (both frantically).

Another specialty is that the Pekoe Trail not just crosses the railway line occasionally, but also literally follows it.
That is normal; all the locals do it.

In fact, as we had reached a viewpoint, we saw a little boy casually walking on the tracks, seemingly not minding the train approaching behind him.
(As opposed to the train passengers, waving frantically at him only earned me a blank stare.)
Eventually, the boy stepped away from the tracks, with plenty of seconds to spare.

It was on that day that I understood just _why_ the trains in Sri Lanka blow their horn so frequently.

By the way:
One [particular hairy bend](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4122622298) there is called the _Soda Bottle Curve,_ although I can't really figure out why.
The name appears to have been around since [at least 1895](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wtc/item/2004707302/).

Arriving in Talawakenne, we turned away from the trail to find our accommodation for the night.
There, we followed our usual routine of removing shoes and any other dirty clothes as far outside as possible.
Settling in, we didn't do too much else given that our today's hike was longer than usual.

## Sixth hiking day: Manager says no (24.10.)

{% include articles/srilanka/map.html name="stage6_7" %}

As usual, we started bright and early.
We copied an earlier strategy and went to some place that was open and asked for _breakfast._
Like last time, it worked perfectly.

We also had another quest:
The night before, my wife's slippers broke.
Fortunately, we found some in town.
(She wouldn't be needing them during the day, but it's easier to look for stuff when you're not already tired after a long hike.)

Today's hike brought us mostly along tea estate roads.
There was no overgrown jungle like in the days before.
As the guide writes:

> Once you leave Thalawakele behind the trail is delightful.
> The elevation changes are perfectly manageable and the trail weaves its way up, down, and across small valleys connecting little hamlets.
> This part feels like a fairy tale, a bit like “The Shire” in Lord of the Rings or the Cotswold Way in England.

It's true.
But bear in mind that after a few days, the trail can also get a bit repetitive.
That doesn't mean that we didn't like it: the opposite.
But let's just say, I believe we've seen a decent amount of tea plantations.

The weather was so-so: only short bursts of rain, but appearing just fast enough that we couldn't put on our rain jackets in time.

Once more, we passed a bunch of tea factories.
_Crystler_ seemed interesting; the entryway was bustling with workers.
We were curious and approached the factory.
Vivi asked if we could take a look:

_Can we see inside?_

_---Manager says it is not allowed._

My wife, ever the negotiator:

_Are you the manager?_

_---No._

Well, there was an attempt.
(Many tea factories can be visited and the tea tried out, but often we were just too early.)

The end point of the sixth stage is the town of Kotagala.
There---for the first time during the trail---we passed by a tea plantation that was being plucked.
Kotagala also has a trains tation, but we continued towards Hatton on the [seventh stage](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-trail/sri-lanka/the-pekoe-trail-stage-07-kotagala-to-norwood-by-pass-hatton-/800415695/) of the _Pekoe Trail._[^hatton]

Unlike the day before, we didn't get as lucky seeing trains.
When we had almost reached Hatton, we spotted a [tunnel entrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singha_Malai_Tunnel).
The _Singimale Tunnel,_ at a length of 562 metres, is the second-longest in Sri Lanka.[^tunnel]
We were there at just the right time for a service from Kandy to Ella.

While we were standing at the viewpoint, locals went in and came out of the tunnel.
It is a shortcut between Hatton and Kotagala.[^shortcut]
I strongly, _strongly,_ advise against doing that.
If you don't know what you're doing, you _will_ die.
The tunnel's clearance is pretty slim, so when the train comes, you'll have to find a nook and/or cranny.

Don't do it.

Our hotel was on a hill to the Northeast of the town centre.
It was pretty nice, albeit probably not as nice as their slogan _Citadel of Nobility_ might indicate.
We arrived there quite early; already at noon.

A bit later, we were reunited with our suitcase that had been delivered from Kandy.
A strange moment, for it meant we had successfully completed just shy of 100 km of more or less walkable trail across central Sri Lanka.
Refreshed and requipped, we ventured to Hatton downtown.

In town, we had only a few tasks:

- Print the train tickets to Ella that we bought only three days prior.
- Eat, preferably in a restaurant with a menu.
- Buy an umbrella for me (for future use).

We had [Kottu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kottu) for dinner, a typical Sri Lankan dish.
The main idea is that you cut roti into small pieces and throw it in a pan together with veggies or meat.
So far, so normal.
Then, the waiter offered us “Dolphin Kottu”.
For a second, they had us thinking that this is Kottu with … well, dolphin meat?
But it just uses a different type of bread and contains yogurt or cheese.
Vivi tried it; I stuck with the regular, non-sea-mammalian one.

</div>

When we arrived back at the hotel, the hosts offered to prepare English breakfast tomorrow.
We went back and forth for a bit, then they suggested a Sri Lankan breakfast instead, which was much preferred.
They were surprised by our choice.
(Maybe we should've just asked for Sri Lankan at Glenloch.)

Satisfied, we went to sleep.

## Ella, Elle L'a (25.10.---27.10.)

[^token]: Some of which even use [tokens](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_(railway_signalling)>) still.
[^hatton]: The seventh stage explicitly says it “bypasses Hatton”, but I think Hatton is a nice place to stay for a night. After Hatton, there is no more rail connection on the trail until the twelfth stage (Idalgashinna and Haputale).
[^tunnel]: Wikipedia is a little confused about the tunnel length ranking; it is the second-longest.
[^shortcut]: Vivi pointed out that going through the tunnel would've been so much shorter than following the trail as we did that day.
