Chances are you're the annoying one.

But don't worry, this list will clear up some common misunderstandings.

1. There are only two genders.
1. Okay, maybe not. But there are only two biological sexes.
1. Fine. Let's just use "M", "F" and "X", that's sufficient.

1. "Transgender" is a gender.
1. "Cis" is not a thing.

1. I can look at someone's DNA and can figure out their sex.
1. Everyone has either a XX or XY chromosome configuration.
1. People who don't have either a XX or XY configuration know that they don't.
1. XX means biological woman. XY means biological man.
1. The Y chromosome is either present in all of a person's cells or it isn't.
1. Period tracking is only for women.
1. Well, men can't have periods, can they?
1. Wait, XY people can have uteruses? Are you joking?
1. There is no way XY people can conceive children.
