<h2>Selected talks</h2>

<p>These are talks that I have given multiple times over the years at various conferences.
Each of them has a dedicated page with slides and the latest recording.
If you want to share a particular talk, I would like to ask you to not link to a recording directly, but rather to the talk's page as linked here.</p>

<dl>
  {% for talk in site.talks %}
    <dt {% if talk.lang %}lang="{{ talk.lang }}"{% endif %}><a href="{{ talk.url }}">{{ talk.title }}</a></dt>
    <dd {% if talk.lang %}lang="{{ talk.lang }}"{% endif %} class="hyphenate">
      {{ talk.abstract }}
    </dd>
  {% endfor %}
</dl>

<h2>Other Talks</h2>

<p>This is a partial list of other talks I gave.
Only talks with recordings are listed here.</p>

<ul>
  {% for talk in site.data.misc_talks reversed %}
    <li>
      {{ talk.title }}, {{ talk.conference }}, {{ talk.year }}
      {% include talk_details.html %}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
