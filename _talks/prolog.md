title: Programmation en Logique
abstract: |
  Prolog is one of the most underrated programming languages around; possibly because of its strange syntax and the unusual paradigm.
  But it is a very nice special-purpose programming language.
  In this talk, I introduce Prolog‚Äôs programming model, showcase some programming domains in which Prolog allows for very concise, elegant programs, and finally describe how it can also be used as a general-purpose tool.

## core.logic edition

At [:clojureD 2020](https://clojured.de/), I gave a version of this talk that uses core.logic instead of Prolog.
