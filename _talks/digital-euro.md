abstract: |
  The work on the Digital Euro is going full steam ahead.
  In January, the European Central Bank has issued calls for applications for component providers, including for example offline payments and fraud & risk management.
  Meanwhile, the European Parliament is considering the legislation in committee.
  In this talk, I will give an update about the current state and developments to be expected in the near future.
