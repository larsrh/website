title: When testing just doesn't cut it
date: 2023-06-22
abstract: |
  Writing unit tests is pretty much standard practice these days.
  Otherwise, how would you make sure that your code does what you expect?
  Yet, some software is mission-critical and merely testing a few examples – or even randomized testing – is not enough.
  To reach higher levels of assurance, we need proof: mathematical, formal proof.
  This session will be based on an example from industry, where we successfully verified the core of a financial application.
  I will describe the core architecture of the system and the mathematical foundations behind the verification, including the classes of problems that we can (or cannot) discover with this approach.
