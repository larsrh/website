title: "Digital Cash: Secure wallets for online and offline payments"
date: 2024-12-27
abstract: |
  When we think of “electronic payments”, there are a lot of different interpretations: bank cards, credit cards, mobile money, QR codes, and more. Lately, many central banks – including the European Central Bank – have started investigating or piloting digital currencies (CBDC) to introduce yet another way to pay electronically. The wish list for CBDC is long: it should support online & offline payments, work as usual at the point of sale, be accessible to users without bank accounts, … At the centre of these design discussions are wallets, powered by secure hardware.

  In this talk, I give an overview over the current CBDC ecosystem, explain some novel techniques that could help to implement wallets at scale, and give a perspective regarding standardisation.
