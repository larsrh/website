title: Advanced Typing in TypeScript
abstract: |
  TypeScript is a powerful language with a type system that has been designed towards common programming patterns in the JavaScript world.
  Coupled with outstanding type inference and IDE support, it makes programming a breeze.
  In this talk, we will take a look at some of the more advanced parts of the type system and how they can be used to create rock-solid APIs.
  As an example we will consider the very common problem of data validation and processing.
  I will show how to build a data pipeline from scratch.
