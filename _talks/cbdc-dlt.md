title: How to integrate CBDC with DLTs?
date: 2023-05-12
abstract: |
  Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is gaining traction as a digital version of cash issued by central banks.
  Several countries have already implemented a CBDC, and many others are actively investigating or piloting one.
  Whatâ€™s clear is that most of these systems run on their dedicated infrastructure, rather than on public and/or existing blockchains.
  This creates interoperability challenges, such as how to transact with CBDCs from existing smart contract ecosystems.
  This talk aims to provide an overview of how CBDCs can be designed to address these challenges, and to provide practical examples of how integration with existing systems could be achieved.
