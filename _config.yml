      abstract: |
        This is a series about Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types, or CRDTs for short.
        Their purpose is to allow seamless replication of data on different nodes in a distributed system.
        Merging is by construction always possible, without any conflicts.
        This series assumes no knowledge about CRDTs, but be prepared to learn a thing or two about algebras.
        All code samples on this page are interactive and executed in your browser.
        Understanding the code is necessary for understanding the concepts, so you should be familiar with JavaScript.
        If you notice any bugs on this page, [please let me know](https://github.com/larsrh/website/issues)!
